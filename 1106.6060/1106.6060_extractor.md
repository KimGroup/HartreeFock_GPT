# Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian (lattice version)
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the CuO$_2$ plane in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin $s$ and site $i$     
The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 
between copper $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital at site $i$ and oxygen $p_\nu$ orbital at site $i+\hat{\nu}/2$ with the amplitude $t_{pd}$, and between neighboring oxygen sites with the amplitude $t_{pp}$.
You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.
The summation should be taken over all spin $s$ and all real space positions.  
Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $\HH_{0}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$\hat{d}^{\dag}_{i,s}$ creates a hole in the copper $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital at site $i$ with spin $s$,
$\hat{p}^{\dag}_{ i+\hat{\nu}/2, s}$ creates a hole in the oxygen $p_\nu$ orbital at the site $i+\hat{\nu}/2$ for $\nu = x, y$, and
$\hat{n}^{d}_{i,s}$, $\hat{n}^{p}_{ i+\hat{\nu}, s}$ are the corresponding number operators. The Cu sites $i$ form a square lattice with unit vectors $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$, and the total number of lattice sites is $N$. The chemical potential $\mu$ and the charge transfer energy $\Delta$ control the total and relative Cu/O hole densities, and $\langle\nu, \nu'\rangle$ point to neighboring oxygen sites.

# Construct interaction Hamiltonian (real space, lattice version)
You will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian, \HH' in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The interacting Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian.  
The interaction is a density-density interaction composed of the following processes:
- Interaction between site i and itself with the interaction strength U_{d}
- Interaction between site i and its neighboring site i+\hat{\nu}/2 with the interaction strength U_{p}/2
- Interaction between site i and its neighboring site i+\hat{\nu}/2 with the interaction strength V_{pd}
- Interaction between site i and its neighboring site i+\hat{\nu}/2' with the interaction strength V_{pp}
The summation should be taken over all spin states (s, s') and all real space positions.  
Return the interaction term \HH' in terms of \hat{n}.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): 
- \HH' is the interaction part of the Hamiltonian
- U_{d}, U_{p}, V_{pd}, and V_{pp} are the interaction strengths
- \hat{n} is the density operator
- i is the site index
- \nu is the direction index
- s and s' are the spin states
- d and p denote different orbitals
- t_{pd}=1 sets the energy scale.

You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term, $\HH_{\rm MF}$, by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $n^{p}_{\nu s}$.  
The expected value $n^{p}_{\nu s}$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, $n^{p}_{i+\hat{\nu}/2 , s}$.  
You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{k_i,k_j}}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.  
You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.  
Return the final simplified Hartree term $\HH_{\rm MF}$.

As proposed in Refs.~\\cite{wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, pan2020band}, the model in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:hubbard} can be simulated in twisted TMD heterobilayers as well as homobilayers. For definiteness, we use twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) as the model system in this work, and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:hubbard} is then constructed following our previous work \\cite{pan2020band} for low-energy holes in the first moir\\'e valence band at $\\pm K$ valleys. Here we use  $c_{i,s}^\\dagger$ to represent the hole operator, and $s=\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ are locked to $+K$ and $-K$ valleys, respectively. We define a filling factor $\\nu$ as $(1/\\mathcal{N}) \\sum_{i,s} c_{i,s}^{\\dagger} c_{i,s} $, which counts the number of holes per moir\\'e cell ($\\mathcal{N}$ is the total number of moir\\'e sites in the system). The charge neutrality point of the semiconducting twisted bilayer corresponds to $\\nu=0$. For simplicity, we assume that  no external out-of-plane displacement field is applied to WSe$_2$, and then the model in  Eq.~\\eqref{eq:hubbard} respects emergent spin SU(2) symmetry and $C_6$ point group symmetry. An important advantage of the moir\\'e platform is that both the hopping parameters and the interaction strength are highly tunable. Generally speaking, the moir\\'e bandwidth becomes narrower at smaller twist angle (larger moir\\'e period) and many-body interaction effects become more prominent~\\cite{wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, naik2018ultraflatbands}. We show the twist-angle dependence of $t$ and $U$ in the Supplemental Material \\cite{SM} (see, also, Refs.~\\cite{fukui2005chern,yu2011equivalent} therein). In the calculation of $U$, we project a screened Coulomb interaction $(e^2/\\epsilon)(1/r-1/\\sqrt{r^2+d^2})$ to the low-energy moir\\'e states, where $\\epsilon$ is the background dielectric constant that is tunable by the dielectric environment and $d/2$ is the distance between the moir\\'e system and a nearby metallic gate. We take $\\epsilon$ as a free parameter and  $d$, which is also experimentally controllable, to be 60 nm in calculations.  \n",

We define a filling factor $\\nu$ as $(1/\\mathcal{N}) \\sum_{i,s} c_{i,s}^{\\dagger} c_{i,s} $, which counts the number of holes per moir\\'e cell ($\\mathcal{N}$ is the total number of moir\\'e sites in the system). The charge neutrality point of the semiconducting twisted bilayer corresponds to $\\nu=0$. For simplicity, we assume that  no external out-of-plane displacement field is applied to WSe$_2$, and then the model in  Eq.~\\eqref{eq:hubbard} respects emergent spin SU(2) symmetry and $C_6$ point group symmetry. An important advantage of the moir\\'e platform is that both the hopping parameters and the interaction strength are highly tunable. Generally speaking, the moir\\'e bandwidth becomes narrower at smaller twist angle (larger moir\\'e period) and many-body interaction effects become more prominent~\\cite{wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, naik2018ultraflatbands}. We show the twist-angle dependence of $t$ and $U$ in the Supplemental Material \\cite{SM} (see, also, Refs.~\\cite{fukui2005chern,yu2011equivalent} therein). In the calculation of $U$, we project a screened Coulomb interaction $(e^2/\\epsilon)(1/r-1/\\sqrt{r^2+d^2})$ to the low-energy moir\\'e states, where $\\epsilon$ is the background dielectric constant that is tunable by the dielectric environment and $d/2$ is the distance between the moir\\'e system and a nearby metallic gate. We take $\\epsilon$ as a free parameter and  $d$, which is also experimentally controllable, to be 60 nm in calculations.  \n",

# Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian (lattice version)
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: the position of site $i$ in a triangular lattice formed in the moir\'e pattern, and the spin index $s$.     
The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 
site i and site j with the amplitude $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$
You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.
The summation should be taken over all degrees of freedom and all real space positions.  
Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$\bm{R}_i$ represents the position of site $i$ in a triangular lattice formed in the moir\'e pattern, $s$ is the spin index, and $t$ and $U$ are, respectively, the hopping parameter and the interaction strength. $c_{i,s}^\dagger$ is used to represent the hole operator, and $s=\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ are locked to $+K$ and $-K$ valleys, respectively. A filling factor $\nu$ is defined as $(1/\mathcal{N}) \sum_{i,s} c_{i,s}^{\dagger} c_{i,s} $, which counts the number of holes per moir\'e cell ($\mathcal{N}$ is the total number of moir\'e sites in the system).

# Construct interaction Hamiltonian (real space, lattice version)
You will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian, $H_{\text{Coulomb}}$ in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The interacting Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian $H$.  
The interaction is a density-density interaction composed of the following process:
site $i$ and site $j$ with the interaction strength $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)$.
The summation should be taken over all spins $s$ and $s'$ and all real space positions.  
Return the interaction term $H_{\text{Coulomb}}$ in terms of $n_{i,s}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): 
$\bm{R}_i$ represents the position of site $i$ in a triangular lattice formed in the moir\'e pattern, $s$ is the spin index, $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)$ is the interaction strength, $n_{i,s}$ is the binary occupancy number of site $i$, and $c_{i,s}^\dagger$ represents the hole operator.

# Convert noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (lattice version)
You will be instructed to convert the noninteracting Hamiltonian H_0 in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis in momentum space. 
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transform to c_{\bm{k},s}^\dagger in the real space to the c_{\bm{k},s}^\dagger in the momentum space, which is defined as \varepsilon_s(\bm{k}), where \bm{k} is integrated over all sites in the entire real space. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transform. [Note that hopping have no position dependence now.]
Express the total noninteracting Hamiltonian H_0 in terms of c_{\bm{k},s}^\dagger. Simplify any summation index if possible.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):
H_0 is the noninteracting Hamiltonian, \bm{k} is the momentum, \varepsilon_s(\bm{k}) is the non-interacting band energy dispersion, and c_{\bm{k},s}^\dagger is the creation operator in momentum space.

# Convert interacting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (lattice version)
You will be instructed to convert the interacting Hamiltonian, H_1, in the second-quantized form the basis in real space to the basis in momentum space.
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transform to c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger in the real space to the c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger in the momentum space, which is defined as U(\bm{q})=\sum_{\bm{R}}U(\bm{R})e^{i\bm{q}\cdot\bm{R}}, where \bm{R} is integrated over all sites in the entire real space, and \bm{q} is defined within the first Brillouin zone. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transform. [Note that interaction have no position dependence now]
Express H_1 in terms of c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger. Simplify any summation index if possible.

# Wick's theorem
You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term, $H_{\text{int}}$.  
You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $H_{\text{int}}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four-term product with and without ${{}}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.  
You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.  
Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation as {Hartree_Fock_symbol}.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$H_{\text{int}}$ is the interaction term, $\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization constant, $s$ and $s'$ are spin indices, $\bm{k}$ is the momentum vector, $U(\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta)$ is the interaction potential, $\delta_{\bm{k}_\alpha,\bm{k}_\beta,\bm{k}_\gamma,\bm{k}_\delta}$ is the Kronecker delta function, $c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger$ and $c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}$ are creation and annihilation operators respectively, and $\expval{...}$ denotes expectation values.

# Extract quadratic term
You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the $H_{\text{int}}$.  
The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to $c_{\bm{k}_\beta,s'}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\gamma,s'}$ and $c_{\bm{k}_\beta,s'}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}$, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.  
You should only preserve the quadratic terms in $H_{\text{int}}$, denoted as $H_{\text{int}}^{(2)}$.  
Return $H_{\text{int}}^{(2)}$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$H_{\text{int}}$ is the interaction Hamiltonian, $\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization factor, $s$ and $s'$ are spin indices, $\bm{k}$ is the momentum vector, $U(\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta)$ is the interaction potential, $\delta_{\bm{k}_\alpha,\bm{k}_\beta,\bm{k}_\gamma,\bm{k}_\delta}$ is the Kronecker delta function, $c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger$ and $c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}$ are creation and annihilation operators, and $\expval{...}$ denotes expectation values.

# Expand interaction
You will be instructed to expand interaction term $V(q)$ in the MF quadratic term $H_{\text{int}}$.
If you find the $V(q)$ in $H_{\text{int}}$ does not contain any momentum that is not in the summation sign. The interaction term is already expanded. No action to perform on interaction term.
Otherwise, you will expand $V(q)$ by replacing $q$ with the momentum $\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta$.
Return $H_{\text{int}}$ with expanded interaction.

# Swap the index only
You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $H_{\text{int}}$ through relabeling the index.  
The logic is that the expected value ($\expval{c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}}$ and $\expval{c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\gamma,s'}}$) in the first Hartree term ($c_{\bm{k}_\beta,s'}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\gamma,s'}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($c_{\bm{k}_\beta,s'}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.  
Namely, a replacement of $\bm{k}_\gamma \leftrightarrow \bm{k}_\delta$ is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes $\bm{k}_\alpha, \bm{k}_\beta$.  
This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $U(\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta)=U(-(\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta))$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.  
Return the simplified $H_{\text{int}}$.

# Reduce momentum in Hartree term (momentum in BZ + reciprocal lattice)
You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term in $H_{\text{Hartree}}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\expval{c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\delta,s}}$.  
The expected value $\expval{c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\delta,s}}$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\delta$ are the same, namely, $\expval{c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}}$.  
You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{\bm{q}_\alpha,\bm{q}_\beta,\bm{q}_\gamma,\bm{q}_\delta}}$ to reduce one momentum $\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha$ but not $\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\delta$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.  
You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.  
Return the final simplified Hartree term $H_{\text{Hartree}}$.

# Reduce momentum in Fock term (momentum in BZ + reciprocal lattice)
You will be instructed to simplify the Fock term in $H_{\text{Fock}}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\expval{c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\gamma,s'}}$.  
The expected value $\expval{c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\gamma,s'}}$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha$ and $\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\gamma$ are the same, namely, $\expval{c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha,s'}}$.  
You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{\bm{q}_\alpha,\bm{q}_\beta,\bm{q}_\gamma,\bm{q}_\delta}}$ to reduce one momentum $\bm{p}_\alpha+\bm{q}_\alpha$ but not $\bm{p}_\beta+\bm{q}_\beta$.  
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.
You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Fock term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.    
Return the final simplified Fock term $H_{\text{Fock}}$.

# Combine the Hartree and Fock term
You will now be instructed to combine the Hartree term {H_{\text{Hartree}}} and the Fock term {H_{\text{Fock}}}.  
You should perform the same trick of relabeling the index in the Fock term to make the quadratic operators in the Fock term the same as those in the Hartree term. The relabeling should be done with a swap : {swap_rule}.
You should add them, relabel the index in Fock term, and simply their sum. 
Return the final sum of Hartree and Fock term.

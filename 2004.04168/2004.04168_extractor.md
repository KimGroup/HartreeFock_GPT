# Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian (lattice version)
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in a system with a triangular lattice in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin states associated with $ +K $ and $-K$ valleys   
The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 
between site i and site j with the amplitude $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$
You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian
The summation should be taken over all spin states and all real space positions.  
Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{\text{TB}}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$s= \uparrow,\downarrow\ $ represents spin $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ states associated respectively with $ +K $ and $-K$ valleys, $ \bm{R}_i $ represents a site in the triangular lattice, and $ c_{j,s} $ ($ c_{j,s}^\dagger $) is  electron annihilation (creation) operator. $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$ is the hopping parameter.

# Construct interaction Hamiltonian (real space, lattice version)
You will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian, $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s}$ in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The interacting Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian $\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}$.  
The interaction is a density-density interaction composed of the following process:
between sites $i$ and $j$ with the interaction strength $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)$.
The summation should be taken over all $s,s'$ and all real space positions.  
Return the interaction term $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s}$ in terms of $c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): 
$t_{s}$ is the hopping parameter, $c_{i,s}^\dagger$ and $c_{j,s}$ are the creation and annihilation operators, respectively, $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)$ is the repulsion between sites $i$ and $j$, and $\epsilon$ is the effective background dielectric constant.

# Convert noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (lattice version)
You will be instructed to convert the noninteracting Hamiltonian {nonint_symbol} in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis in momentum space. 
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transformation to {real_creation_op} in the real space to the {momentum_creation_op} in the momentum space, which is defined as {definition_of_Fourier_Transformation}, where {real_variable} is integrated over all sites in the entire real space. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation. [Note that hopping have no position dependence now.]
Express the total noninteracting Hamiltonian {nonint_symbol} in terms of {momentum_creation_op}. Simplify any summation index if possible.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):

# Convert interacting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (lattice version)
You will be instructed to convert the interacting Hamiltonian, {second_int_symbol}, in the {single-particle|second-quantized} form the basis in real space to the basis in momentum space.
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transformation to {real_creation_op} in the real space to the {momentum_creation_op} in the momentum space, which is defined as {definition_of_Fourier_Transformation}, where {real_variable} is integrated over all sites in the entire real space, and {momentum_var} is defined within the first Brillouin zone. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation. [Note that interaction have no position dependence now]
Express {second_int_symbol} in terms of {momentum_creation_op}. Simplify any summation index if possible.

# Wick's theorem
You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term, {second_int_symbol}.  
You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in {second_int_symbol} into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four term product with and without ${{}}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.  
You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.  
Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation as {Hartree_Fock_symbol}.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):

# Extract quadratic term
In this paper, we will be focusing on the Hartree-Fock term, denoted as H. The quadratic terms refer to terms that are proportional to the bilinear operator, denoted as B. These terms exclude those that are solely expectations or products of expectations. We will only preserve the quadratic terms in H, which we will denote as H'. 

The following conventions for the symbols are used: 
H represents the Hartree-Fock term, B represents the bilinear operator, and H' represents the Hartree-Fock term with only the quadratic terms preserved. 

Template:
 You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the {H}.  
The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to {B}, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.  
You should only preserve the quadratic terms in {H}, denoted as {H'}.  
Return {H'}.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
H represents the Hartree-Fock term, B represents the bilinear operator, and H' represents the Hartree-Fock term with only the quadratic terms preserved.

# Construct full Hamiltonian after HF
The Hartree-Fock approximation is denoted as H^HF. The kinetic Hamiltonian, denoted as T, is given by the expression -1/2 ∑_i ∇^2_i. The interacting Hamiltonian, denoted as V, is given by the expression 1/2 ∑_i ∑_j (1/|r_i - r_j|). After the Hartree-Fock approximation, the entire Hamiltonian, denoted as H, is given by the expression T + V^HF. The symbols i and j denote the electrons, r_i and r_j denote the positions of the electrons, and ∇^2_i denotes the Laplacian operator acting on electron i.

Template filled:
You will be instructed to construct the entire Hamiltonian after the Hartree-Fock approximation H^HF. 
You should first recall the Kinetic Hamiltonian T is -1/2 ∑_i ∇^2_i.  
You should then recall the interacting Hamiltonian V is 1/2 ∑_i ∑_j (1/|r_i - r_j|).  
You should then combine T with the interacting Hamiltonian V after the Hartree-Fock approximation, which is the entire Hamiltonian H after Hartree-Fock.  
Return the expression for H.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
The symbols i and j denote the electrons, r_i and r_j denote the positions of the electrons, and ∇^2_i denotes the Laplacian operator acting on electron i.

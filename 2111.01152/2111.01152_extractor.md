# Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian (continuum version, single-particle)
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in a system with two layers in the momentum space in the second-quantized form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: valleys, layers, and momentum.  
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian H_{\tau} using variables which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of bottom layer and top layer. Note that the sublattice degrees of freedom is suppressed for now and will be stated later.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$\tau=\pm 1$ represents $\pm K$ valleys, $\bm{\kappa}=\frac{4\pi}{3a_M}\left(1,0\right)$ is at a corner of the moiré Brillouin zone. The $2\times 2$ Hamiltonian hybridizes the bottom layer ($\mathfrak{b}$) and top layer ($\mathfrak{t}$), where the off diagonal terms describe the interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}$, and the diagonal terms describe the momentum-shifted kinetic energy with the effective mass $(m_{\mathfrak{b}},m_{\mathfrak{t}})=(0.65,0.35)m_e$ ($m_e$ is the rest electron mass), plus the intralayer potential $\Delta_{\mathfrak{b}/\mathfrak{t}}$, and a band offset $V_{z\mathfrak{t}}$.

# Define each term in Kinetic Hamiltonian (continuum version)

# Convert noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (continuum version)
You will be instructed to convert the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis by momentum space.  
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transformation to $\Psi_{\tau}^\dagger(\bm{r})$ in the real space to $c_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau}^\dagger$ in the momentum space, which is defined as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_0=\sum_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},\bm{k}_{\beta}}\sum_{l_{\alpha},l_{\beta}}\sum_{\tau} h_{\bm{k}_{\alpha}l_{\alpha},\bm{k}_{\beta}l_{\beta}}^{(\tau)} c_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau}$, where $\bm{r}$ is integrated over the entire real space.

The subscripts $\alpha,\beta$ are index for momenta. Due to Bloch's theorem, $h_{\bm{k}_{\alpha}l_{\alpha},\bm{k}_{\beta}l_{\beta}}^{(\tau)}$ is nonzero only when $\bm{k}_{\alpha}-\bm{k}_{\beta}$ is equal to the linear combination of any multiples of one of the moir\'e reciprocal lattice vectors (including the zero vector).

# Construct interaction Hamiltonian (momentum space)
You will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}$ in the momentum space.  
The interaction Hamiltonian is a product of four parts.
The first part is the product of four operators with two creation and two annihilation operators following the normal order, namely, creation operators are before annihilation operators. You should follow the order of $l_{\alpha},l_{\beta},l_{\beta},l_{\alpha}$ for the index of operator, and $\bm{k}_{\alpha},\bm{k}_{\beta},\bm{k}_{\gamma},\bm{k}_{\delta}$ for the momentum. 
The second part is the constraint of total momentum conservation, namely the total momentum of all creation operators should be the same as that of all annihilation operators.  
The third part is the interaction form. You should use dual-gate screened Coulomb interaction with $V(\bm{k})= {2\pi e^2\tanh(|\bm{k}|d)}/{(\epsilon |\bm{k}|)}$, where $\bm{k}$ is the transferred total momentum between a creation operator and an annihilation operator with the same index of operator, namely $\bm{k}=\bm{k}_{\alpha}-\bm{k}_{\delta}$.  
The fourth part is the normalization factor, you should use $\frac{1}{2A}$ here.
Finally, the summation should be running over all index of operator, and momentum

$\bm{k}_{\alpha},\bm{k}_{\beta},\bm{k}_{\gamma},\bm{k}_{\delta}$ are the momenta, $l_{\alpha},l_{\beta}$ are the indices of operators, $\tau_{\alpha},\tau_{\beta}$ are the spin indices, $V(\bm{k})$ is the dual-gate screened Coulomb interaction, $d$ is the sample-to-gate distance, and $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant.

# Wick's theorem
You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$.  
You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four term product with and without ${{}}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.  
You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.  
Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ is the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$ is the interaction term in the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, $\bm{k}_{\alpha},\bm{k}_{\beta},\bm{k}_{\gamma},\bm{k}_{\delta}$ are the momentum vectors, $l_{\alpha},l_{\beta}$ are the orbital quantum numbers, $\tau_{\alpha},\tau_{\beta}$ are the spin quantum numbers, $V(\bm{k}_{\alpha}-\bm{k}_{\delta})$ is the interaction potential, $b_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}^\dagger$ and $b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$ are the creation and annihilation operators, and $\expval{...}$ denotes the expectation value.

# Extract quadratic term
You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the Hartree-Fock term symbol, denoted as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$.  
The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}$ and $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.  
You should only preserve the quadratic terms in $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$, denoted as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$.  
Return $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ is the Hartree-Fock term symbol, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$ is the Hartree-Fock second quantized symbol, and $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}$ and $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$ are the bilinear operators.

# Swap the index to combine Hartree and Fock terms
You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.  
The logic is that the expected value ($\expval{b_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}}$ and $\expval{b_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}}$) in the first Hartree term ($b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.  
This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.  
You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.  
Return the simplified $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term).

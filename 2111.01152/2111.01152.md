# Hamiltonian construction

## Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian (continuum version, single-particle)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: valley index (+K and -K valley), layer index (top and bottom layer). 
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ using $E_{\tau,l}$ which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$l$ : layer index   
$t$ : top layer  
$b$ : bottom layer  
$\tau$ : valley index  
$+K$ : +K valley  
$-K$ : -K valley  
$k$ : momentum operator  
$E_{l,\tau}$ : energy dispersion for layer $l$ and valley $\tau$   

**Completion:**  
Given the degrees of freedom and the symbols defined, the kinetic Hamiltonian for a single particle in real space can be expressed as a 4x4 diagonal matrix:

$$H_{Kinetic}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
E_{b,+K} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & E_{t,+K} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & E_{b,-K} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & E_{t,-K}
\end{bmatrix}$$

This Hamiltonian describes the energy of a single particle in the system, where the diagonal elements represent the energy dispersion for each combination of layer and valley index. For instance, $E_{b,+K}$ corresponds to the energy of a particle in the +K valley of the bottom layer, while $E_{t,-K}$ refers to the energy of a particle in the -K valley of the top layer. The off-diagonal elements are zero, reflecting the fact that these terms would involve transitions between different layers or valleys, which are not part of the kinetic energy term.

## Define each term in Kinetic Hamiltonian (continuum version)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix, namely the energy dispersion $E_{l,\tau}(k)$.  
For all energy dispersions, $E_{l,\tau}(k)$, it characterizes the parabolic dispersion for hole.   
In addition, an shift of $+\kappa$ and $-\kappa$ in the momentum $k$ for $E_{t,+K}$ and $E_{t,-K}$, respectively. 
You should follow the EXAMPLE below to obtain correct energy dispersion, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the type of dispersion.
Finally, in the real space, the momentum $k=-i \partial_r$. You should keep the form of $k$ in the Hamiltonian for short notations but should remember $k$ is an operator.  
Return the expression for four $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ in the Kinetic Hamiltonian, and substitute it into the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$k$ : momentum operator  
$r$ : real space operator  
$m_l$ : the effective mass for layer $l$  
$\tilde{\tau}$ : takes value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$  
$\pm\kappa$ : corners of monolayer moire Brillouin zone 

===  
EXAMPLE 1:  
A parabolic dispersion for electron is $E_{\alpha}=\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_{\alpha}}$, where $\alpha$ indicates the type of electron.  If there is a further shift of $q$ in the momentum $k$, the dispersion will become $E_{\alpha}=\frac{\hbar^2 (k-q)^2}{2m_{\alpha}}$.

EXAMPLE 2:
A parabolic dispersion for hole is $E_{\alpha}=-\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_{\alpha}}$, where $\alpha$ indicates the type of hole.  If there is a further shift of $q$ in the momentum $k$, the dispersion will become $E_{\alpha}=-\frac{\hbar^2 (k-q)^2}{2m_{\alpha}}$.

EXAMPLE 3:  
A dirac dispersion for electron/hole is a 2 by 2 matrix, i.e., $h_{\theta}(k)=-\hbar v_D |k| \begin{pmatrix}  0 & e^{i(\theta_{k}-\theta)}\\ e^{-i(\theta_{\bar{k}}-\theta)} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, where $v_D$ is the Fermi velocity, $\theta$ is the twist angle, and $\theta_k$ indicates the azumith angle of $k$. If there is a further shift of $K_{\theta}$ in the momentum $k$, the dispersion will become $h_{\theta}(k)=-\hbar v_D |k-K_{\theta}| \begin{pmatrix}  0 & e^{i(\theta_{k-K_{\theta}}-\theta)}\\ e^{-i(\theta_{k-K_{\theta}}-\theta)} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

**Completion:** 

Following the instructions and referring to EXAMPLE 2, the energy dispersions $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ for hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 are given by:

For $E_{b,+K}(k)$:
This is a parabolic dispersion for a hole with no shift in momentum. So,
$E_{b,+K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_b}$.

For $E_{t,+K}(k)$:
This is a parabolic dispersion for a hole with a shift of $+\kappa$ in momentum. So,
$E_{t,+K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 (k-\kappa)^2}{2m_t}$.

For $E_{b,-K}(k)$:
This is a parabolic dispersion for a hole with no shift in momentum. So,
$E_{b,-K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_b}$.

For $E_{t,-K}(k)$:
This is a parabolic dispersion for a hole with a shift of $-\kappa$ in momentum. So,
$E_{t,-K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 (k+\kappa)^2}{2m_t}$.

Now, substituting these into the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}$, we get:

$$H_{Kinetic}(r) = \begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 (k-\kappa)^2}{2m_t} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 (k+\kappa)^2}{2m_t} \\
\end{pmatrix}.$$

## Construct Potential Hamiltonian (continuum version)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the potential term of Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ in the real space in the single-particle form.  
The potential Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$.  
The diagonal terms are $\Delta_l(r)$
The off-dagonal terms are the coupling between $t$ and $b$, $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$, which should be kept hermitian.  
All others terms are zero.
Express the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ using $\Delta_l(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\Delta_l$: intralayer potential for layer index $l$  
$\Delta_{T,\tau}$ : interlayer tunneling at valley index $\tau$  
$H_{Potential}(r)$ : potential term of Hamiltonian in the real space in the single-particle form.

**Completion:**  
Given your instructions, the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ for the system can be expressed as:

$$H_{Potential}(r) = \begin{pmatrix}
\Delta_b(r) & \Delta_{T,+K}(r) & 0 & 0 \\
\Delta_{T,+K}^\dagger(r) & \Delta_t(r) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \Delta_b(r) & \Delta_{T,-K}(r) \\
0 & 0 & \Delta_{T,-K}^\dagger(r) & \Delta_t(r) \\
\end{pmatrix}.$$

The diagonal terms $\Delta_l(r)$ represent the intralayer potential for each layer, while the off-diagonal terms $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$ and its Hermitian conjugate $\Delta_{T,\tau}^\dagger(r)$ represent interlayer tunneling at each valley. All other terms are set to zero.

## Define each term in Potential Hamiltonian (continuum version)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix $H_{Potential}(r)$, namely, the intralayer potential $\Delta_l(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  
The diagonal terms are: $\Delta_t(r) = V_{zt}$ and $\Delta_b(r)$ is $2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b)$.
The off-diagonal terms are: $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)=w(1+\omega^{1}e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r})$ and $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)=-w(1+\omega^{-1}e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r})$.
Return the expressions for the intralayer potential $\Delta_t(r)$ and $\Delta_b(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)$, and substitute it into the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$V_{zt}$ : displacement field on the top layer  
$V_b$ : bottom layer potential strength  
$\psi_b$ : bottom layer potential phase  
$g_j$ : reciprocal unit vector on the first shell corresponding in the moire Brillouin zone, j varies from 1 to 6.  
$r$ : real space position  
$\omega$ : phase factor to respect the threefold rotational symmetry, which is $e^{i2\pi/3}$, the hermitian conjugate is $\omega^{-1}=e^{-i2\pi/3}$  
$w$ : interlayer tunneling strength 

**Completion:**  
Following the instructions, the intralayer potentials $\Delta_t(r)$ and $\Delta_b(r)$ and the interlayer tunneling terms $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)$ are given by:

$\Delta_t(r) = V_{zt}$,

$\Delta_b(r) = 2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r + \psi_b)$,

$\Delta_{T,+K}(r) = w(1+\omega^{1}e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r})$,

$\Delta_{T,-K}(r) = -w(1+\omega^{-1}e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r})$.

Substituting these expressions into the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$, we obtain:

$$H_{Potential}(r) = \begin{pmatrix}
V_{zt} & w(1+\omega^{1}e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r}) & 0 & 0 \\
w(1+\omega^{-1}e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r}) & 2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r + \psi_b) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & V_{zt} & -w(1+\omega^{1}e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r}) \\
0 & 0 & -w(1+\omega^{-1}e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r}) & 2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r + \psi_b) \\
\end{pmatrix}.$$

## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in matrix
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space.  
The noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space $H^{0}$ is the sum of Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ and Potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  
To construct the second quantized form of a Hamiltonian. You should construct the creation and annihilation operators from the basis explicitly. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to convert a Hamiltonian from the single-particle form to second-quantized form.  
Finally by "total", it means you need to take a summation over the real space position $r$.   
Return the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ : electron annihilation operator at valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$  
$\vec{\psi}(r)$ : spinor containing all annihilation operators $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ following the same order of $H^{0}$  
$H^{0}(r)$ : single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  
$\hat{H}^{0}$ : total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
For a Hamiltonian $H$, where $`H=\begin{pmatrix} H_{a,a} & H_{a,b} \\ H_{b,a} & H_{b,b} \end{pmatrix}`$ and the order of basis is (a), (b), we can construct the creation operators $\psi_a^\dagger$  and $\psi_b^\dagger$, and the annihilation operator $\psi_a$  and $\psi_b$.  
The corresponding second quantized form is $\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}$, where $`\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}`$.  

**Completion:**  
Following the convention, the annihilation operators for the four states are ordered as follows: 

$$\vec{\psi}(r) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{+K,b}(r) \\ \psi_{+K,t}(r) \\ \psi_{-K,b}(r) \\ \psi_{-K,t}(r) \end{bmatrix}$$

The conjugate transpose (or the adjoint) of this operator gives us the creation operators:

$$\vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{+K,b}^\dagger(r) & \psi_{+K,t}^\dagger(r) & \psi_{-K,b}^\dagger(r) & \psi_{-K,t}^\dagger(r) \end{pmatrix}$$

The noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space, $H^{0}(r)$, is the sum of the kinetic and potential Hamiltonians, i.e., $H^{0}(r) = H_{Kinetic}(r) + H_{Potential}(r)$.

Given that, the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian can be written as:
$$\hat{H}^{0} = \int dr \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$$

Therefore, the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian is the spatial integral over the matrix element of the Hamiltonian, sandwiched between the creation and annihilation operators.

## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in summation (expand the matrix)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to expand the second-quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ using $`H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$ and $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to expand the Hamiltonian.  
You should use any previous knowledge to simplify it. For example, if any term of $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ is zero, you should remove it from the summation.
You should recall that {expression_}  
Return the expanded form of $\hat{H}^{0}$ after simplication.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ : the matrix element of single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
For a $`\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}$, where $\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}`$, we can expand it as  $`\hat{H}=\sum_{i,j=\{a,b\}} \psi_i^\dagger H_{i,j} \psi_j`$.    

**Completion:**  
The total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ is given by

$\hat{H}^{0} = \int dr \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$

We expand this expression as:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \int dr \sum_{\tau_1, l_1, \tau_2, l_2} \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$

However, because there is no hybridization between the +K and -K valleys, i.e., $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) = 0$ when $\tau_1 \neq \tau_2$, we can simplify the expression as:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \int dr \sum_{l_1, l_2} \left( \psi_{+K,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{+K,l_1,+K,l_2}(r) \psi_{+K,l_2}(r) + \psi_{-K,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{-K,l_1,-K,l_2}(r) \psi_{-K,l_2}(r) \right)`$

Now, we sum over layer indices $l_1$ and $l_2$ for each valley index.

## Convert noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (continuum version)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to convert the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis by momentum space.  
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transformation to $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ in the real space to the $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$ in the momentum space, which is defined as $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int dr \psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation.  
Express the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ in terms of $c_{\tau,l}(k)$ and $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$. Simplify any summation index if possible.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$c_{l,\tau}(k)$ : electron annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$ : electron creation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$V$ : area of unit cell in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Write a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the second quantized form, $\hat{H}=\int dr \psi(r)^\dagger H(r) \psi(r)$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space.  
Define the Fourier transformation $c^\dagger(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int \psi^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r} dr$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space, and $V$ is the area of the unit cell in the real space.  
This leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $\psi^\dagger(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_k c^\dagger(k) e^{-i k \cdot r}$, where $k$ is summed over the extended Brillouin zone (i.e., the entire momentum space), $\Omega$ is the area of Brillouin zone in the momentum space.  
Thus, substitute $\psi^\dagger(r)$ and $\psi(r)$ into $\hat{H}$, we get  
$$\hat{H} = \int dr \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_1} c^\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \cdot r} H(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_2} c(k_2) e^{i k_2 \cdot r} =\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) \frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r) c(k_2) = \sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) H(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$$  
, where we define the Fourier transformation of $H(r)$ as $H(k_1,k_2)=\frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r)$.

**Completion:**  
From the given example and conventions, we can first apply the Fourier transformation to $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$:

$$c_{\tau,l}(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int dr \psi_{\tau,l}(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$$

This yields the inverse Fourier transformation:

$$\psi_{\tau,l}(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_k c_{\tau,l}(k) e^{-i k \cdot r}$$

Next, we substitute the inverse Fourier transformations of $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ and $\psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r)$ into the expression for $\hat{H}^{0}$:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \int dr \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_1} c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \cdot r}\right) H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_2} c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2) e^{i k_2 \cdot r}\right)`$

This simplifies to:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2) \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2) \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r)`$

Defining the Fourier transformation of $`H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r)`$ as $`H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) = \frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2) \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r)`$, we finally get:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2)`$

This represents the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ in terms of the creation and annihilation operators $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$ and $c_{\tau,l}(k)$ in the momentum space, summed over all valleys, layers, and momenta.

## Particle-hole transformation
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to perform a particle-hole transformation.  
Define a hole operator, $b_{l,\tau}(k)$, which equals $c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$.  
You should replace $c_{l,\tau}$ with $b_{l,\tau}(k)^\dagger$, and $c_{l,\tau}^\dagger$ with $b_{l,\tau}(k)$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the particle-hole transformation.  
You should recall that $\hat{H}^{0} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2)$.  
Return the $\hat{H}^{0}$ in the hole operators.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$b_{l,\tau}(k)$ : hole annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Give a Hamiltonian  $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) h(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$ , and the particle-hole transformation as $b(k)=c^\dagger(k)$. The transformed Hamiltonian is $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2} b(k_1) h(k_1,k_2) b^\dagger(k_2)$ 


**Completion:**  
Following the example and the definition of the hole operator, we can perform the particle-hole transformation on the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$. We substitute $b_{\tau, l}(k) = c_{\tau, l}^\dagger(k)$ into the expression for $\hat{H}^{0}$.

The resulting Hamiltonian is then:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2) b_{\tau, l_2}^\dagger(k_2)`$

In this expression, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are summed over the entire Brillouin zone, $l_1$ and $l_2$ are summed over all layers, and $\tau$ is summed over the valley indices.


## Simplify the Hamiltonian in the particle-hole basis
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to simplify the $\hat{H}^{0}$ in the hole basis.  
You should use canonical commutator relation for fermions to reorder the hole operator to the normal order. Normal order means that creation operators always appear before the annihilation operators.  You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it to the normal order.  
Express the $\hat{H}^{0}$ in the normal order of $`b_{l,\tau}(k)`$ and also make $`l_1`$/$`k_1`$ always appear before $`l_2$/$k_2`$ in the index of $b$ and $H$.  

You should call this final version as $\hat{H}^{0,final}$ and remember it.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\delta_{i,j}$ : Kronecker delta function, take the value of 1 if $i=j$, and 0 otherwise.  
$`[b_i, b_j]_{+}`$ : anticommuting relation, i.e., $`[b_i, b_j]_+= b_i b_j +b_j b_i`$  
$\hat{H}^{0,final}$ : the final version of noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ in the hole basis after simplification.  

===
EXAMPLE:  
For $\hat{H}^{0}= \sum_{i,j} b_i H_{i,j} b_j^\dagger$, where $b_i$ satisfies fermion statistics (anticommuting to its self-adjoint operator).  
This gives $`[b_i, b_j^\dagger]_{+} = \delta_{i,j}`$, which means $b_i b_j^\dagger=\delta_{i,j}-b_j^\dagger b_i$.  
Substitute it into $\hat{H}^{0}$, we have $\hat{H}^{0}=\sum_{i,j} (\delta_{i,j}-b_j^\dagger b_i) H_{i,j}=\sum_{i,j} \delta_{i,j} H_{i,j} - \sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}=\sum_i H_{i,i} - \sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}$.  
The first term is simply $\sum_i H_{i,i}$ by summing over the index $j$ due to $\delta_{i,j}$.
The second term is $-\sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}$.  
Relabeling the index of $i$ and $j$ by swapping them to make it consistent with the original order of index (namely, $i$ appears before $j$ in the index of $b$ and $H$), it becomes $-\sum_{i,j}b_i^\dagger H_{j,i} b_j$.
Finally, to fix the order of the index in $H$ such that $i$ appears before $j$, we notice that $`H_{j,i}=(H_{i,j})^*`$, where $`^*`$ means complex conjugate, because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian.  
Thus, we end up in $\hat{H}^{0}=\sum_{i,j} b_i H_{i,j} b_j^\dagger=\sum_i H_{i,i}-\sum_{i,j}b_i^\dagger (H_{i,j})^* b_j$

**Completion:**  
Following the example provided, we can simplify the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ in the hole basis using the anticommutator relation $`[b_{\tau,l}(k), b_{\tau,l'}^\dagger(k')]_+ = \delta_{l,l'} \delta_{k,k'}`$ where the Kronecker delta function $\delta_{l,l'}$ takes the value 1 if $l=l'$ and 0 otherwise, and similarly for $\delta_{k,k'}$.

We have:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2) b_{\tau, l_2}^\dagger(k_2)`$

Applying the anticommutator relation gives:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} (\delta_{l_1,l_2}\delta_{k_1,k_2}-b_{\tau, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau, l_1}(k_1)) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2)`$

Then, we simplify the above expression by performing the summations over $l_2$ and $k_2$ on the term containing the Kronecker deltas and relabeling the indices. We also replace $`H^{0}_{\tau, l_2, \tau, l_1}(k_2, k_1)`$ by its complex conjugate $`(H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2))^*`$ because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. We obtain:

$`\hat{H}^{0} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, k_1} H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_1}(k_1, k_1) - \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) (H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2))^* b_{\tau, l_2}(k_2)`$

This is the final version of the noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0}$ in the hole basis, denoted by $\hat{H}^{0,final}$:

$`\hat{H}^{0,final} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, k_1} H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_1}(k_1, k_1) - \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) (H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2))^* b_{\tau, l_2}(k_2)`$

## Construct interaction Hamiltonian (momentum space)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ in the momentum space.  
The interaction Hamiltonian is a product of four parts.
The first part is the product of four operators with two creation and two annihilation operators following the normal order, namely, creation operators are before annihilation operators. You should follow the order of $1,2,2,1$ for the valley index and layer index, and $1,2,3,4$ for the momentum.  
The second part is the constraint of total momentum conservation, namely the total momentum of all creation operators should be the same as that of all annihilation operators. For each operator, the momentum is $k_i$.  
The third part is the interaction form. You should use the dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction $V(q)=2\pi e^2\tanh(|q| d)/(\epsilon |q|)$, where $q$ is the transferred total momentum between a creation operator and an annihilation operator of the same spin and layer, namely $q=k_1-k_4$.   
The fourth part is the normalization factor, you should use $\frac{1}{2 V}$ here.
Finally, the summation should be running over all layer index, valley index, and momentum.
Return the interaction term $\hat{H}^{int}$ in terms of $b_{l,\tau}(k)$ and $V(q)$ (with $q$ expressed in terms of $k_i$).

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$d$ : distance between dual gates  
$\epsilon$ : dielectric constant  
$V(q)$ : dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction in the momentum space

**Completion:**  
The interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ can be written as a sum over all momenta, valleys, and layers. It includes four operator terms (two creation operators and two annihilation operators), the interaction form $V(q)$, the constraint of total momentum conservation, and a normalization factor. 

Considering the normalization factor $\frac{1}{2 V}$ and following the order of $1,2,2,1$ for the indices and $k_1$ to $k_4$ for the momenta, we have:

$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) V(q) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$

The interaction form is given by the dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction, $V(q)=\frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|q| d)}{\epsilon |q|}$, where $q$ is the momentum difference between the creation and annihilation operators of the same type of spin and layer. Specifically, we can express $q$ in terms of the creation and annihilation momenta: $q = k_1 - k_4 = k_2 - k_3$. Hence,

$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|} b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$

The constraint of total momentum conservation is reflected by the delta function: $\delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4}$.

Therefore, the final form of the interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ becomes:

$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|} b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$

# Mean-field theory
## Wick's theorem
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term $\hat{H}^{int}$.  
You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $\hat{H}^{int}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four term product with and without ${}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.  
You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.  
You should recall that $\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2V}\sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1)b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2)b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3)b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) V(|k_1-k_4|)\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$.
Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_2) \rangle$ : expectation of $b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_2)$ over the many-body ground states.

EXAMPLE 1:  
For a four-fermion term $a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger a_3 a_4$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms. this is expanded as $a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger a_3 a_4 = \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_2^\dagger a_3 + \langle a_2^\dagger a_3 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_4 - \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle \langle a_2^\dagger a_3\rangle - \langle a_1^\dagger a_3 \rangle a_2^\dagger a_4 - \langle a_2^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_3 + \langle a_1^\dagger a_3\rangle \langle a_2^\dagger a_4 \rangle$  
Be cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term here.

EXAMPLE 2:  
For a four-fermion term $a_1^\dagger a_2 a_3^\dagger a_4$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms. this is expanded as $a_1^\dagger a_2 a_3^\dagger a_4 = \langle a_1^\dagger a_2 \rangle a_3^\dagger a_4 + \langle a_3^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_2 - \langle a_1^\dagger a_2 \rangle \langle a_3^\dagger a_4\rangle - \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_3^\dagger a_2 - \langle a_3^\dagger a_2 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_4 + \langle a_1^\dagger a_4\rangle \langle a_3^\dagger a_2 \rangle$  
Be cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term here.

**Completion:**  
We can apply the Wick's theorem to the interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ and only keep the normal terms. Note that the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator. Be aware of the signs and the order of indices in the following expansion:

For the four-fermion term in $\hat{H}^{int}$, $b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms, we expand it as follows:

$b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) = \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)- \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle - \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle$

Here $\langle b_{\tau_i, l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j, l_j}(k_j) \rangle$ is the expectation of $b_{\tau_i, l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j, l_j}(k_j)$ over the many-body ground states.

Therefore, the interaction term after the Hartree-Fock approximation $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$ becomes:

$\hat{H}^{int,HF} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|}[ \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)+ \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle - \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle]$

## Extract quadratic term
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$.  
The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to $b^\dagger b$, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.  
You should only preserve the quadratic terms in $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$, which is called $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$.
You should recall that $\hat{H}^{int,HF}=\frac{1}{2V}\sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} \left[\langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4)-\langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) \rangle \langle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) \rangle - \langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) \rangle \langle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) \rangle\right] V(|k_1-k_4|)\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$.
Return this Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ : the quadratic terms in $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$

**Completion:**  
Sure, we can extract the quadratic terms from the Hartree-Fock approximated interaction Hamiltonian. The quadratic terms are the ones which contain the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.

From the previously expanded $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$, we only preserve the quadratic terms, which give us $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$:

$\hat{H}^{int,HF,2} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|} [ \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)+ \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)- \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)- \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)]$

This Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$, now only contains terms that are products of a creation operator and an annihilation operator, with coefficients involving expectations of such products.

# Simplify the MF quadratic term
## Swap the index to combine Hartree and Fock terms
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.  
The logic is that the expected value ($`\langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_1}(k_4) \rangle`$) in the first Hartree term ($`\langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_3)`$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($`\langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_1}(k_4)`$), and vice versa.  The same applies to the Fock term.  
This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.  
You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.  
You should recall that $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}=\frac{1}{2V}\sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} \left[\langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{l_2,\tau_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{l_1,\tau_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_3)\right] V(|k_1-k_4|)\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$.   
Return the simplied $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)

===  
EXAMPLE:
Given a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) + \langle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \rangle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$.  
In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\sigma_1 \leftrightarrow \sigma_2$, $\sigma_3 \leftrightarrow \sigma_4$, $k_1 \leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \leftrightarrow k_4$. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.  
Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.
Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that this form of second term after relabeling is identical to the first term.  
Finally, we have the simplified Hamiltonian as  $\hat{H}=2\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

**Completion:**  
In your example, by relabeling indices to swap the indices of the expected value and the indices of the quadratic operators in the second term, we can combine the two similar terms.

We will follow the same procedure with the $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ to simplify it. For the second Hartree term, we perform the index relabeling: $(\tau_1,l_1,k_1) \leftrightarrow (\tau_2,l_2,k_2)$ and $(\tau_1,l_1,k_4) \leftrightarrow (\tau_2,l_2,k_3)$, we find the two Hartree terms can be combined. And we apply the same process for the Fock terms: $(\tau_1,l_1,k_1) \leftrightarrow (\tau_2,l_2,k_2)$ and $(\tau_2,l_2,k_3) \leftrightarrow (\tau_1,l_1,k_4)$.

Therefore, the simplified $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ reduces to only two terms, one Hartree and one Fock term:

$\hat{H}^{int,HF,2} = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|}[ \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)- \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)]$

Please note the 2 factor out front due to the combination of the two identical terms for Hartree and Fock respectively, and the signs in front of the terms remain the same as before.

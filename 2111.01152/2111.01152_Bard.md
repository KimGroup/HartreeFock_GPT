# Hamiltonian construction

## Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form. 
The degrees of freedom of the system are: valley index (+K and -K valley), layer index (top and bottom layer).  
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ using $E_{\tau,l}$ which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).  

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$l$ : layer index  
$t$ : top layer  
$b$ : bottom layer  
$\tau$ : valley index  
$+K$ : +K valley  
$-K$ : -K valley  
$E_{\tau,l}$ : energy dispersion for valley $\tau$ and layer $l$  
$H_{Kinetic}(r)$ : kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the real space in the single-particle form  

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The kinetic Hamiltonian for the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form can be expressed as follows:

$`H_{Kinetic}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
E_{+K,b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & E_{+K,t} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & E_{-K,b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & E_{-K,t} \\
\end{array}
\right)`$

where $E_{\tau,l}$ is the energy dispersion for valley $\tau$ and layer $l$. The basis is arranged in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).

The reason why the kinetic Hamiltonian is only on the diagonal terms is because the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 is a two-dimensional system, and there is no coupling between different momentum states.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Define each term in Kinetic Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix, namely the energy dispersion $E_{l,\tau}(k)$.  
For all energy dispersions, $E_{l,\tau}(k)$, it characterizes the dispersion for free holes, namely, $E_{l,\tau}(k)= -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_l}$.   
In addition, for the top layer, $E_{\tau,t}(k)$, there is a shift of momentum $k$, to make the band bottom at $\tilde{\tau}\kappa$.  
Finally, in the real space, the momentum $k=-i \partial_r$. You should keep the form of $k$ in the Hamiltonian for short notations but should remember $k$ is an operator.  
Return the expression for four $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ in the Kinetic Hamiltonian, and substitute it into the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):
$k$ : momentum operator  
$r$ : real space operator  
$m_l$ : the effective mass for layer $l$  
$\tilde{\tau}$ : takes value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$  
$\pm\kappa$ : corners of monolayer moire Brillouin zone  

**Completion:**  

Sure, I can help you with that.

The energy dispersion for free holes is given by:

$E_{l,\tau}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_l}$

where $l$ is the layer index, $\tau$ is the valley index, $k$ is the momentum, and $m_l$ is the effective mass for layer $l$.

For the top layer, the momentum is shifted by $\tilde{\tau}\kappa$, so the energy dispersion for the top layer is given by:

$E_{\tau,t}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 (k - \tilde{\tau}\kappa)^2}{2 m_t}$

where $\tilde{\tau}$ takes the value of +1 for $\tau = +K$ and -1 for $\tau = -K$.

The kinetic Hamiltonian for the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form can now be expressed as follows:

$`H_{Kinetic}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
E_{+K,b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & E_{+K,t} - \tilde{+K}\kappa^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & E_{-K,b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & E_{-K,t} - \tilde{-K}\kappa^2 \\
\end{array}
\right)`$

where $E_{\tau,l}$ is the energy dispersion for valley $\tau$ and layer $l$. The basis is arranged in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Define each term in Kinetic Hamiltonian [Revised]
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix, namely the energy dispersion $E_{l,\tau}(k)$.  
For all energy dispersions, $E_{l,\tau}(k)$, it characterizes the dispersion for free holes, namely, $E_{l,\tau}(k)= -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_l}$.   
In addition, for the top layer, $E_{\tau,t}(k)$, there is a shift of momentum $k$, to make the band bottom at $\tilde{\tau}\kappa$. Namely, $E_{l,\tau}(k)= -\frac{\hbar^2 (k-\tilde{\tau}\kappa)^2}{2 m_l}$. 
Finally, in the real space, the momentum $k=-i \partial_r$. You should keep the form of $k$ in the Hamiltonian for short notations but should remember $k$ is an operator.  
Return the expression for four $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ in the Kinetic Hamiltonian, and substitute it into the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):
$k$ : momentum operator  
$r$ : real space operator  
$m_l$ : the effective mass for layer $l$  
$\tilde{\tau}$ : takes value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$  
$\pm\kappa$ : corners of monolayer moire Brillouin zone  

**Completion:**  

Sure, I can help you with that.

The energy dispersion for the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space can be expressed as follows:

$E_{l,\tau}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 (k - \tilde{\tau}\kappa)^2}{2 m_l}$

where $k$ is the momentum operator, $r$ is the real space operator, $m_l$ is the effective mass for layer $l$, $\tilde{\tau}$ takes value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$, and $\pm\kappa$ are the corners of monolayer moire Brillouin zone.

The kinetic Hamiltonian for the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 can then be expressed as follows:

$`H_{Kinetic}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
-\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 (k-\kappa)^2}{2 m_t} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 (k+\kappa)^2}{2 m_t} \\
\end{array}
\right)`$

where the basis is arranged in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Construct Potential Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the potential term of Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ in the real space in the single-particle form.  
The potential Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$.  
At each valley, it is a 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$, where each component is layer index. The diagonal term in this 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is  intralayer tunneling $\Delta_l(r)$. The off-diagonal term in this 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is interlayer potential $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$, which should be kept hermitian.   
There is no hybridization between $+K$ valley and $-K$ valley, i.e., the corresponding matrix elements in $H_{Potential}(r)$ are all zero.  
Express the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ using $\Delta_l(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also remember the conventions in my previous prompts if there are no conflicts. If you have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\Delta_l$: intralayer potential for layer index $l$  
$\Delta_{T,\tau}$ : interlayer tunneling at valley index $\tau$  
$H_{Potential}(r)$ : potential term of Hamiltonian in the real space in the single-particle form.  

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The potential Hamiltonian for hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form can be expressed as follows:

$`H_{Potential}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\Delta_b(r) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \Delta_t(r) & \Delta_{T,+K}(r) & 0 \\
0 & \Delta_{T,+K}(r) & \Delta_b(r) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \Delta_t(r) \\
\end{array}
\right)`$

where $\Delta_l(r)$ is the intralayer potential for layer $l$, and $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$ is the interlayer potential at valley index $\tau$.

The diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian represent the intralayer potential for holes in each layer. The off-diagonal terms represent the interlayer tunneling between holes in different layers.

The fact that there is no hybridization between $+K$ valley and $-K$ valley is reflected in the fact that the corresponding matrix elements in $H_{Potential}(r)$ are all zero.

This is the potential Hamiltonian for hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.


## Construct Potential Hamiltonian [Revised]
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the potential term of Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ in the real space in the single-particle form.  
The potential Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$. Namely, it can be rewritten as $`H_{Potential}(r)=\begin{pmatrix} H_{Potential,+K}(r) & 0 \\ 0 & H_{Potential,-K}(r) \end{pmatrix}`$, where $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is a 2 by 2 matrix for valley $\tau$.  
At each valley, it is a 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$, where each component is layer index. The diagonal term in this 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is  intralayer tunneling $\Delta_l(r)$. The off-diagonal term in this 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is interlayer potential $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$, which should be kept hermitian. This means,  if you put $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$ on $i,j$ entry of the matrix, you should put $\Delta_{T,\tau}^*(r)$ on the $j,i$ entry of the matrix.
There is no hybridization between $+K$ valley and $-K$ valley, i.e., the corresponding matrix elements in $H_{Potential}(r)$ are all zero.  
Express the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ using $\Delta_l(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also remember the conventions in my previous prompts if there are no conflicts. If you have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\Delta_l$: intralayer potential for layer index $l$  
$\Delta_{T,\tau}$ : interlayer tunneling at valley index $\tau$  
$H_{Potential}(r)$ : potential term of Hamiltonian in the real space in the single-particle form.  

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The potential Hamiltonian for hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form can be expressed as follows:

$`H_{Potential}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\Delta_b(r) & \Delta_{T,+K}(r) & 0 & 0 \\
\Delta_{T,+K}^*(r) & \Delta_t(r) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \Delta_b(r) & \Delta_{T,-K}(r) \\
0 & 0 & \Delta_{T,-K}^*(r) & \Delta_t(r) \\
\end{array}
\right)`$

where $\Delta_l$ is the intralayer potential for layer $l$, and $\Delta_{T,\tau}$ is the interlayer tunneling at valley index $\tau$.

The diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian represent the potential energy of the holes in each valley and layer. The off-diagonal terms represent the tunneling between holes in different layers.

Note that there is no hybridization between $+K$ valley and $-K$ valley, so the corresponding matrix elements in $H_{Potential}(r)$ are all zero.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Comments:**  
Here the modification is to add "Namely, it can be rewritten as $`H_{Potential}(r)=\begin{pmatrix} H_{Potential,+K}(r) & 0 \\ 0 & H_{Potential,-K}(r) \end{pmatrix}`$, where $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is a 2 by 2 matrix for valley $\tau$." to fix the position of interlayer tunneling.  
Another thing is to add "This means,  if you put $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$ on $i,j$ entry of the matrix, you should put $\Delta_{T,\tau}^*(r)$ on the $j,i$ entry of the matrix." to remind it take the hermitian congujate on the lower off-diagonal terms. 

## Define each term in Potential Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix $H_{Potential}(r)$, namely, the intralayer potential $\Delta_l(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  
The intralayer on the top layer $\Delta_t(r)$ is $V_{zt}$.  
The intralayer on the bottom layer $\Delta_b(r)$ is $2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b)$.  
The interlayer tunneling at valley $\tau$ is $\tilde{\tau}w(1+\omega^{\tilde{\tau}}e^{i\tilde{\tau} g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2\tilde{\tau}} e^{i\tilde{\tau} g_3 \cdot r})$.  
Return the expressions for the intralayer potential $\Delta_t(r)$ and $\Delta_b(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)$, and substitute it into the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$V_{zt}$ : displacement field on the top layer  
$V_b$ : bottom layer potential strength  
$\psi_b$ : bottom layer potential phase  
$g_j$ : reciprocal unit vector on the first shell corresponding in the moire Brillouin zone, j varies from 1 to 6.  
$r$ : real space position  
$\omega$ : phase factor to respect the threefold rotational symmetry, which is $e^{i2\pi/3}$, the hermitian conjugate is $\omega^{-1}=e^{-i2\pi/3}$  
$w$ : interlayer tunneling strength

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The intralayer potential on the top layer is given by:

$\Delta_t(r) = V_{zt}$

The intralayer potential on the bottom layer is given by:

$\Delta_b(r) = 2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b)$

The interlayer tunneling at valley $\tau$ is given by:


$\Delta_{T,\tau}(r) = \tilde{\tau}w(1+\omega^{\tilde{\tau}}e^{i\tilde{\tau} g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2\tilde{\tau}} e^{i\tilde{\tau} g_3 \cdot r})$


where $\tilde{\tau}$ takes the value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$.

Substituting these expressions into the potential Hamiltonian, we get:


$`H_{Potential}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
V_{zt} & \tilde{w}(1+\omega e^{ig_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{ig_3 \cdot r}) & 0 & 0 \\
\tilde{w}(1+\omega^{-1} e^{-ig_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-ig_3 \cdot r}) & 2V_b\cos(g_1 \cdot r + \psi_b) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & V_{zt} & \tilde{w}(1+\omega e^{-ig_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{-ig_3 \cdot r}) \\
0 & 0 & \tilde{w}(1+\omega^{-1} e^{ig_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{ig_3 \cdot r}) & 2V_b\cos(g_1 \cdot r + \psi_b) \\
\end{array}
\right)`$


This is the potential Hamiltonian for hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form.

**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix $H_{Potential}(r)$, namely, the intralayer potential $\Delta_l(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  
The intralayer on the bottom layer $\Delta_b(r)$ is $2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b)$.  
The intralayer on the top layer $\Delta_t(r)$ is $V_{zt}$.  
The interlayer tunneling at valley $+K$, $\Delta_{T,+K}$, is $w (1+\omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{i g_3 \cdot r})$.  
The interlayer tunneling at valley $-K$, $\Delta_{T,-K}$, is $-w (1+\omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r})$.  
You should also remember to take hermitian conjugate properly.
Return the expressions for the intralayer potential $\Delta_t(r)$ and $\Delta_b(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)$, and substitute it into the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The intralayer potential on the bottom layer is given by:

$\Delta_b(r) = 2 V_b \sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r + \psi_b)$

The intralayer potential on the top layer is given by:

$\Delta_t(r) = V_{zt}$

The interlayer tunneling at valley $+K$ is given by:

$\Delta_{T,+K}(r) = w (1 + \omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{i g_3 \cdot r})$

The interlayer tunneling at valley $-K$ is given by:

$\Delta_{T,-K}(r) = -w (1 + \omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r})$

The Hermitian conjugate of $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)$ is given by:

$\Delta_{T,+K}^*(r) = w (1 + \omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r})$

The Hermitian conjugate of $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)$ is given by:

$\Delta_{T,-K}^*(r) = -w (1 + \omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{i g_3 \cdot r})$

Substituting these expressions into the potential Hamiltonian, we get:


$`H_{Potential}(r) = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
2 V_b \sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r + \psi_b) & w (1 + \omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{i g_3 \cdot r}) & 0 & 0 \\
w (1 + \omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r}) & V_{zt} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2 V_b \sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r + \psi_b) & -w (1 + \omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^2 e^{i g_3 \cdot r}) \\
0 & 0 & -w (1 + \omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r}) & V_{zt} \\
\end{array}
\right)`$

This is the potential Hamiltonian for hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Comments:**  
Here the first fix is quite funny: I reverse the order of mentioning the top and bottom layer. Without that, it will insist to put top layer first on the (1,1) position despite it has already obtained the correct order of basis in the previous response.  
The second modification is that I need to give the definition of interlayer tunneling explicitly for the +K valley followed by -K valley, instead of just making a general statement of a valley $\tau$.  
The third modification is to remind it take hermitian conjugate, which otherwise, it will forget.

## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in the matrix
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space.  
The noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space $H^{0}$ is the sum of Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ and Potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  
To construct the second quantized form of a Hamiltonian. You should construct the creation and annihilation operators from the basis explicitly. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to convert a Hamiltonian from the single-particle form to second-quantized form.  
Finally by "total", it means you need to take a summation over the real space position $r$.   
Return the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ : electron annihilation operator at valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$  
$\vec{\psi}(r)$ : spinor containing all annihilation operators $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ following the same order of $H^{0}$  
$H^{0}(r)$ : single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  
$\hat{H^{0}}$ : total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form

For a Hamiltonian $H$, where $`H=\begin{pmatrix} H_{a,a} & H_{a,b} \\ H_{b,a} & H_{b,b} \end{pmatrix}`$ and the order of basis is (a), (b), we can construct the creation operators $\psi_a^\dagger$  and $\psi_b^\dagger$, and the annihilation operator $\psi_a$  and $\psi_b$.  
The corresponding second quantized form is $\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}$, where $`\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}`$ and $`\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}`$.

$\psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r)$ : hole creation operator at valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$
$\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ : hole annihilation operator at valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$


The single-particle Hamiltonian in the real space can be converted to second-quantized form as follows:


$\hat{H^{0}}(r) = \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$


where $\vec{\psi}(r)$ is the spinor containing all annihilation operators $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ following the same order of $H^{0}$.

Finally, the summation over the real space position $r$ can be performed as follows:


$\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^3r \hat{H^{0}}(r)$


The second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space is given by:


$\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^3r \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$


This is the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form.

$\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ : hole annihilation operator at valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$, which annihilates a hole at position $r$ with valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$.  

The single-particle Hamiltonian in the real space can be converted to second-quantized form as follows:

$\hat{H^{0}}(r) = \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$, where $\vec{\psi}(r)$ is a spinor containing all annihilation operators $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ following the same order of $H^{0}$.

The summation over the real space position $r$ can be performed as follows:

$\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \hat{H^{0}}(r)$

Therefore, the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space is given by:

$\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Comments:**  
Here the only fix is to emphasize that "using $\vec{\psi}(r)$ and $H^{0}(r)$." when expressing the second quantized form.

## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in summation (expand the matrix)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to expand the second-quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ using $`H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$ and $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to expand the Hamiltonian.  
You should use any previous knowledge to simplify it. For example, if any term of $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ is zero, you should remove it from the summation.  
Return the expanded form of $\hat{H^{0}}$ after simplication.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ : the matrix element of single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
For a $`\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}`$, where $`\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}`$ and $`\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}`$, we can expand it as  $`\hat{H}=\sum_{i,j=\{a,b\}} \psi_i^\dagger H_{i,j} \psi_j`$. 

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space can be expanded as follows:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \sum_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$


where $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ is the matrix element of the single-particle Hamiltonian in the real space.

The summation over the real space position $r$ can be performed as follows:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}`$


Therefore, the expanded form of the second quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ is given by:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}`$


I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in summation (expand the matrix) [Revised]
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to expand the second-quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ using $`H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ and $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)`$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to expand the Hamiltonian.  
You should use any previous knowledge to simplify it. For example, if any term of $`H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$ is zero, you should remove it from the summation. You should notice that the intervalley coupling is zero, i.e., $`H^{0}_{+K,l_1,-K,l_2}(r)=H^{0}_{-K,l_1,+K,l_2}(r)=0`$.  
Return the expanded form of $\hat{H^{0}}$ after simplication.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ : the matrix element of single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
For a $`\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}$, where $\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}`$ and $`\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}`$, we can expand it as  $`\hat{H}=\sum_{i,j=\{a,b\}} \psi_i^\dagger H_{i,j} \psi_j`$. 

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The expanded form of the second quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ can be obtained by expanding the product of the creation and annihilation operators as follows:

$`\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r) = \int d^2r \sum_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(r) \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$


The intervalley coupling is zero, so the terms with $\tau_1 \neq \tau_2$ will be zero. This means that the summation over $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ will only be over the same valley.

Therefore, the expanded form of the second quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ is given by:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(r) \psi_{\tau,l_2}(r)`$


I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.


**Comments:**  
Here the fix is to explicitly state "the intervalley coupling is zero, i.e., $`H^{0}_{+K,l_1,-K,l_2}(r)=H^{0}_{-K,l_1,+K,l_2}(r)=0`$." Without this, it seems that it does not know it should use this information.

## Convert noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (continuum version)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to convert the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis by momentum space.  
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transformation to $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ in the real space to the $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$ in the momentum space, which is defined as $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int dr \psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation.  
Express the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in terms of $c_{\tau,l}(k)$ and $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$. Simplify any summation index if possible.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$c_{l,\tau}(k)$ : electron annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$ : electron creation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$V$ : area of unit cell in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Write a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the second quantized form, $\hat{H}=\int dr \psi(r)^\dagger H(r) \psi(r)$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space.  
Define the Fourier transformation $c^\dagger(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int \psi^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r} dr$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space, and $V$ is the area of the unit cell in the real space.  
This leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $\psi^\dagger(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_k c^\dagger(k) e^{-i k \cdot r}$, where $k$ is summed over the extended Brillouin zone (i.e., the entire momentum space), $\Omega$ is the area of Brillouin zone in the momentum space.  
Thus, substitute $\psi^\dagger(r)$ and $\psi(r)$ into $\hat{H}$, we get  
$$\hat{H} = \int dr \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_1} c^\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \cdot r} H(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_2} c(k_2) e^{i k_2 \cdot r} =\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) \frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r) c(k_2) = \sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) H(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$$  
, where we define the Fourier transformation of $H(r)$ as $H(k_1,k_2)=\frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r)$.

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The Fourier transformation of the creation and annihilation operators in the real space can be written as follows:

$$c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int d^2r \psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r) e^{-i k \cdot r}$$
$$c_{\tau,l}(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int d^2r \psi_{\tau,l}(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$$

where $V$ is the area of the unit cell in the real space.

The total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the momentum space can be obtained by applying the Fourier transformation to the Hamiltonian in the real space as follows:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r) = \int d^2r \sum_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(r) \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$
$`= \sum_{k_1,k_2} \frac{1}{V} \int d^2r \int d^2r e^{-i (k_1 - k_2) \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(r) \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$
$`= \sum_{k_1,k_2} c_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(k_1 - k_2) c_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_2)`$

where we have defined the Fourier transformation of the Hamiltonian as follows:

$`H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(k_1 - k_2) = \frac{1}{V} \int d^2r e^{-i (k_1 - k_2) \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)`$

Therefore, the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the momentum space is given by:

$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{k_1,k_2} c_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(k_1 - k_2) c_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_2)`$

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to convert the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis by momentum space.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation.  
Recall that $`\hat{H^{0}}= \int d^2r \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(r) \psi_{\tau,l_2}(r)`$  
Express the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in terms of $c_{\tau,l}(k)$ and $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$. Simplify any summation index if possible.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$c_{l,\tau}(k)$ : electron annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$ : electron creation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$V$ : area of unit cell in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Write a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the second quantized form, $\hat{H}=\int dr \psi(r)^\dagger H(r) \psi(r)$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space.  
Define the Fourier transformation $c^\dagger(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int \psi^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r} dr$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space, and $V$ is the area of the unit cell in the real space.  
This leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $\psi^\dagger(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_k c^\dagger(k) e^{-i k \cdot r}$, where $k$ is summed over the extended Brillouin zone (i.e., the entire momentum space), $\Omega$ is the area of Brillouin zone in the momentum space.  
Thus, substitute $\psi^\dagger(r)$ and $\psi(r)$ into $\hat{H}$, we get  
$$\hat{H} = \int dr \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_1} c^\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \cdot r} H(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{k_2} c(k_2) e^{i k_2 \cdot r} =\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) \frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r) c(k_2) = \sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) H(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$$  
, where we define the Fourier transformation of $H(r)$ as $H(k_1,k_2)=\frac{1}{V} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r)$.

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The Fourier transformation of the creation and annihilation operators can be written as follows:

$c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int d^2r \psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$
$c_{\tau,l}(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \int d^2r \psi_{\tau,l}(r) e^{-i k \cdot r}$

where $V$ is the area of the unit cell in the real space.

The Fourier transformation of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian can be written as follows:

$`\hat{H^{0}} = \int d^2r \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(r) \psi_{\tau,l_2}(r) \\
= \frac{1}{V} \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r) e^{-i (k_1-k_2) \cdot r} c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2) \\
= \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2)`$

where $`H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) = \frac{1}{V} \int d^2r e^{-i (k_1-k_2) \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(r)`$.

Therefore, the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the momentum space is given by:

$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2)`$


I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Comments:**  
This fix is to force it "recall" the Hamiltonian of $\hat{H^{0}}$ by explicitly providing the equation. Without it, Bard will not use the fact that the intervalley coupling is zero ($\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are not reduced to the same $\tau$).

## Apply Particle-hole transformation
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to perform a particle-hole transformation.  
Define a hole operator, $b_{l,\tau}(k)$, which equals $c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$.  
You should replace $c_{l,\tau}$ with $b_{l,\tau}(k)^\dagger$, and $c_{l,\tau}^\dagger$ with $b_{l,\tau}(k)$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the particle-hole transformation.
Return the $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole operators.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$b_{l,\tau}(k)$ : hole annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Give a Hamiltonian  $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) h(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$ , and the particle-hole transformation as $b(k)=c^\dagger(k)$. The transformed Hamiltonian is $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2} b(k_1) h(k_1,k_2) b^\dagger(k_2)$ 


**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The particle-hole transformation can be performed as follows:

$b_{l,\tau}(k) = c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$
$c_{l,\tau}(k) = b_{l,\tau}(k)^\dagger$

The total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the momentum space can be transformed as follows:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) c_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\tau,l_2}(k_2) \\
= \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) b_{\tau,l_1}(k_1) b_{\tau,l_2}^\dagger(k_2)`$


Therefore, the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the momentum space in the hole operators is given by:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) b_{\tau,l_1}(k_1) b_{\tau,l_2}^\dagger(k_2)`$


I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Simplify the Hamiltonian in the particle-hole basis
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to simplify the $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole basis.  
You should use canonical commutator relation for fermions to reorder the hole operator to the normal order. Normal order means that creation operators always appear before the annihilation operators.  You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it to the normal order.  
Express the $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the normal order of $b_{l,\tau}(k)$ and also make $l_1$/$`k_1`$ always appear before $l_2$/$`k_2`$ in the index of $b$ and $H$.  
You should call this final version as $\hat{H}^{0,final}$ and remember it.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\delta_{i,j}$ : Kronecker delta function, take the value of 1 if $i=j$, and 0 otherwise.  
$`[b_i, b_j]_{+}`$ : anticommuting relation, i.e., $`[b_i, b_j]_+= b_i b_j +b_j b_i`$  
$\hat{H}^{0,final}$ : the final version of noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole basis after simplification.  

===
EXAMPLE:  
For $\hat{H^{0}}= \sum_{i,j} b_i H_{i,j} b_j^\dagger$, where $b_i$ satisfies fermion statistics (anticommuting to its self-adjoint operator).  
This gives $`[b_i, b_j^\dagger]_{+} = \delta_{i,j}`$, which means $b_i b_j^\dagger=\delta_{i,j}-b_j^\dagger b_i$.  
Substitute it into $\hat{H^{0}}$, we have $\hat{H^{0}}=\sum_{i,j} (\delta_{i,j}-b_j^\dagger b_i) H_{i,j}=\sum_{i,j} \delta_{i,j} H_{i,j} - \sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}=\sum_i H_{i,i} - \sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}$.  
The first term is simply $\sum_i H_{i,i}$ by summing over the index $j$ due to $\delta_{i,j}$.
The second term is $-\sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}$.  
Relabeling the index of $i$ and $j$ by swapping them to make it consistent with the original order of index (namely, $i$ appears before $j$ in the index of $b$ and $H$), it becomes $-\sum_{i,j}b_i^\dagger H_{j,i} b_j$.
Finally, to fix the order of the index in $H$ such that $i$ appears before $j$, we notice that $`H_{j,i}=(H_{i,j})^*`$, where $`^*`$ means complex conjugate, because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian.  
Thus, we end up in $`\hat{H^{0}}=\sum_{i,j} b_i H_{i,j} b_j^\dagger=\sum_i H_{i,i}-\sum_{i,j}b_i^\dagger (H_{i,j})^* b_j`$

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The canonical commutator relation for fermions is given by:

$`[b_i, b_j]_{+} = \delta_{ij}`$

This means that $b_i b_j^\dagger = \delta_{ij} - b_j^\dagger b_i$.

We can use this to simplify the noninteracting Hamiltonian in the hole basis as follows:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) b_{\tau,l_1}(k_1) b_{\tau,l_2}^\dagger(k_2)`$
$`= \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} \left( \delta_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2) - b_{\tau,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau,l_1}(k_1) \right) H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2)`$
$`= \sum_{k_1} \sum_{\tau,l} H^{0}_{\tau,l,\tau,l}(k_1,k_1) - \sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} b_{\tau,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau,l_1}(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2)`$

The first term is simply $`\sum_{k_1} H^{0}_{\tau,l,\tau,l}(k_1,k_1)`$ by summing over the index $`l_2`$ due to $`\delta_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}`$.

The second term is $-\sum_{k_1,k_2} \sum_{\tau,l_1,l_2} b_{\tau,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau,l_1}(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2)$.

Relabeling the index of $l_1$ and $l_2$ by swapping them to make it consistent with the original order of index (namely, $l_1$ appears before $l_2$ in the index of $b$ and $H$), it becomes $`-\sum_{k_1,k_2} b_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau,l_2,\tau,l_1}(k_2,k_1) b_{\tau,l_2}(k_2)`$.

Finally, to fix the order of the index in $H$ such that $l_1$ appears before $l_2$, we notice that $`H^{0}_{\tau,l_2,\tau,l_1}(k_2,k_1) = (H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2))^*`$, where $`^*`$ means complex conjugate, because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian.

Thus, we end up in:


$`\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{k_1} H^{0}_{\tau,l,\tau,l}(k_1,k_1) - \sum_{k_1,k_2} b_{\tau,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) (H^{0}_{\tau,l_1,\tau,l_2}(k_1,k_2))^* b_{\tau,l_2}(k_2)`$

We can call this final version as $\hat{H}^{0,final}$.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Construct interaction Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ in the momentum space.  
The interaction Hamiltonian is a product of four parts.
The first part is the product of four operators with two creation and two annihilation operators following the normal order, namely, creation operators are before annihilation operators. The order of valley index $\tau_i$ is 1,2,2,1. The order of layer index $l_i$ is 1,2,2,1. The order of the momentum $k_i$ is 1,2,3,4.
The second part is the constraint of total momentum conservation, namely the total momentum of all creation operators should be the same as that of all annihilation operators.  
The third part is the interaction form. You should use the dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction $V(q)=2\pi e^2\tanh(|q| d)/(\epsilon |q|)$, where $q$ is the transferred total momentum between a creation operator and an annihilation operator of the same spin and layer, namely $q=k_1-k_4$ .   
The fourth part is the normalization factor, you should use $\frac{1}{2 V}$ here.
Finally, the summation should be running over all layer index, valley index, and momentum.
Return the interaction term $\hat{H}^{int}$ in terms of $b_{l,\tau}(k)$ and $V(q)$ (with $q$ expressed in terms of $k_i$ and $b_i$).

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$d$ : distance between dual gates  
$\epsilon$ : dielectric constant  
$V(q)$ : dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction in the momentum space

**Completion:**  
Sure, I can help you with that.

The interaction part of the Hamiltonian in the momentum space can be constructed as follows:



$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} \delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4} V(q) b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4)$


where $q = k_1 - k_4$ is the transferred momentum between a creation operator and an annihilation operator of the same spin and layer.

The summation over the layer index, valley index, and momentum is denoted by $\sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}$.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

# Mean-field theory
## Wick’s theorem
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term $\hat{H}^{int}$.  
You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $\hat{H}^{int}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four term product with and without ${}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.   
You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.  
Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_2) \rangle$ : expectation of $b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_2)$ over the many-body ground states.

EXAMPLE:  
For a four-fermion term $a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger a_3 a_4$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms. this is expanded as $a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger a_3 a_4 = \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_2^\dagger a_3 + \langle a_2^\dagger a_3 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_4 - \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle \langle a_2^\dagger a_3\rangle - \langle a_1^\dagger a_3 \rangle a_2^\dagger a_4 - \langle a_2^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_3 + \langle a_1^\dagger a_3\rangle \langle a_2^\dagger a_4 \rangle$  
Be cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term here.

The Hartree-Fock approximation can be performed as follows:


The four-fermion term in $\hat{H}^{int}$ can be expanded using Wick's theorem as follows:


$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} \delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4} V(k_1-k_4) \left( b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \right)$

$= \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} \delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4} V(k_1-k_4) \left( \langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \right.$

$- \langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) \rangle - \langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3)$

$+ \left. \langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_3) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \rangle \right)$


Here, the first two terms are the Hartree terms, the next two terms are the Fock terms, and the last term is the exchange term.


We can only keep the normal terms, which are the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator. Therefore, the Hartree-Fock approximation of the interaction term is given by:


$`\hat{H}^{int,HF} = \frac{1}{2 V} \sum_{\tau_1,\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2} \delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4} V(k_1-k_4) \left( \langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_1}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_2}(k`$

**Comments:**  
Although Bard almost returns the correct answer, there are two issues, 1. the variance is quite large, namely, while I tried different times, the sign convention and contraction of which two operators can be very different; 2. the output is cut off probably because it hits Bard's max token.

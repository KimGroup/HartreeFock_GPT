For single-particle physics, we calculate the band topological phase diagram and electron local density of states (LDOS), which are found to be correlated. By comparing our theoretical LDOS with those measured by scanning tunneling microscopy, we comment on the possible topological nature of the first moiré valence band. For many-body physics, we construct a generalized Hubbard model on a triangular lattice based on the calculated single-particle moiré bands. We show that a layer potential difference, arising, for example, from an applied electric field, can drastically change the noninteracting moiré bands, tune the spin-orbit coupling in the Hubbard model, control the charge excitation gap of the Mott insulator at half-filling, and generate an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the effective Heisenberg model for the Mott insulator. Our theoretical results agree with transport experiments on the same system in several key aspects, and establish twisted bilayer WSe2 as a highly tunable system for studying and simulating strongly correlated phenomena in the Hubbard model.","2020-07-16","2022-11-29 04:26:35","2023-06-26 03:09:56","2020-08-09 00:26:57","033087","","3","2","","Phys.

In a ""realistic"" bilayer model with moderate strength local Coulomb interactions, the existence of a sharp divergence of the electronic density of states near a van Hove singularity of the quasi-one-dimensional bands, and the spin-orbit couplings permitted by the presence of multiple orbitals result in a mean-field phase diagram which accounts for many of these experimentally observed phenomena.

It is characterized by on-site repulsive electron-electron interactions, causing antiferromagnetism, and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, giving rise to d-wave superconductivity. Due to a special choice for the lattice, this model has a strong-coupling limit where the superconductivity can be described by a bosonic theory, similar to the strongly coupled negative U Hubbard model. This limit is analyzed in the present paper. A rich mean-field phase diagram is found and the leading quantum corrections to the mean-field results are calculated. The first-order line between the antiferromagnetic- and the superconducting phase is found to terminate at a tricritical point, where two second-order lines originate. At these lines, the system undergoes a transition to- and from a phase exhibiting both antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity. At finite temperatures above the spin-disordering line, quantum-critical behavior is found. For specific values of the model parameters, it is possible to obtain SO(5) symmetry involving the spin- and the phase-sector at the tricritical point. Although this symmetry is explicitly broken by the projection to the lower Hubbard band, it survives on the mean-field level, and modes related to a spontaneously broken SO(5) symmetry are present on the level of the random phase approximation in the superconducting phase.","2000-02-01","2023-06-12 20:20:47","2023-06-26 15:56:09","2023-06-12 20:20:04","3676-3690","","5","61","","Phys.

The system accommodates many symmetry-broken ground states both in charge and isospin sectors at various commensurate rational fillings such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, etc. We investigate two complementary important aspects of the dependence of the symmetry breaking on (1) the range of the electron-electron interaction, which can in principle be experimentally controlled by the nearby gates and the dielectric environment, and (2) temperature, which could thermally suppress the symmetry breaking above a critical temperature. Experimental implications of the theory are discussed.","2022-01-18","2023-06-15 20:59:01","2023-06-26 03:07:35","2022-05-04 03:18:14","041109","","4","105","","Phys. Rev.

We find metallic states slightly away from half-filling, as have recently been observed experimentally.

Strong long-range Coulomb interaction in the Moiré-Hubbard model induces Wigner crystals at a series of fractional filling factors. The effective lattice of the Wigner crystal is controlled by the filling factor, and can be triangle, rectangle, honeycomb, kagome, etc., providing a single platform to realize many different spin models on various lattices by simply tuning carrier density. In addition to Wigner crystals that are topologically trivial, interaction-induced Chern insulators emerge in the phase diagram. This finding paves a way for engineering interaction-induced quantum anomalous Hall effect in Moiré-Hubbard systems where the corresponding single-particle Moiré band is topologically trivial.","2020-11-05","2023-06-15 20:59:23","2023-06-26 03:12:38","2020-12-01 20:32:29","201104","","20","102","","Phys.

The low energy physics of some of these materials has been shown to be described by a ""moir\'e Hubbard model"" generalized from the usual Hubbard model by the addition of strong, tunable spin orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a Hartree-Fock approximation to reach a comprehensive understanding of the moir\'e Hubbard model on the mean field level. We determine the magnetic and metal-insulator phase diagrams, and assess the effects of spin orbit coupling, inversion symmetry breaking, and the tunable van Hove singularity. We also consider the spin and orbital effects of applied magnetic fields. This work provides guidance for experiments and sets the stage for beyond mean-field calculations.","2021-08-26","2023-06-23 19:41:29","2023-06-26 15:30:29","2023-06-23 19:41:29","075150","","7","104","","Phys.

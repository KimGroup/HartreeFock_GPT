Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol}.

You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $M_{\alpha\beta}(\bk)$ through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ($\langle d^\dagger_{\bq,\alpha^\prime,\sigma^\prime}d^{\phantom\dagger}_{\bq,\beta^\prime,\sigma^\prime} \rangle$) in the first Hartree term ($U^{\sigma\sigma^\prime}_{\beta,\alpha^\prime,\alpha,\beta^\prime} + U^{\sigma^\prime\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime,\beta,\beta^\prime,\alpha}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($U^{\sigma\sigma}_{\alpha^\prime,\beta,\alpha,\beta^\prime} + U^{\sigma\sigma}_{\beta,\alpha^\prime,\beta^\prime,\alpha}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of $\alpha^\prime,\beta,\beta^\prime,\alpha$ is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes $\bq,\sigma,\sigma^\prime$.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified $M_{\alpha\beta}(\bk)$.

I will provide you a Excerpt of physics paper, and a Template. You will need to fill the placeholders in the template using the correct information from the excerpt.
Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

Finally, if you cannot figure out the placeholder, you should leave it as is.

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term, {Hartree\_second\_quantized\_symbol}, by reducing the momentum inside the expected value {expected\_value}.

The expected value {expected\_value} is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, {expected\_value\_nonzero}.

You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{k_i,k_j}}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

Return the final simplified Hartree term {Hartree\_second\_quantized\_symbol}.

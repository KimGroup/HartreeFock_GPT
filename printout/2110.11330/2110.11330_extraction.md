We control the range of the Coulomb interactions by including a finite number of neighbors coupled in the theory. These neighbors are denoted by hexagonal ``shells''  (e.g., on-site interaction $U_0$ is 0-shell, 1-shell means six nearest-neighbor interactions $U_1$ plus $U_0$) in the following results. By comparing the results of short-range (few shells) and long-range (many shells) interactions, we investigate the role of the interaction range.

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol}.

where $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$ is the hopping between the moir\'e lattice site $i$ and $j$, fitted from the first moir\'e valence band of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\pm K$ valleys in the noninteracting picture, and $s=\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ are coupled with the $+K$ and $-K$ valleys~\cite{pan2020band}. $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)$ describes the Coulomb repulsion between site $i$ and $j$. We control the range of the Coulomb interactions by including a finite number of neighbors coupled in the theory. These neighbors are denoted by hexagonal ``shells''  (e.g., on-site interaction $U_0$ is 0-shell, 1-shell means six nearest-neighbor interactions $U_1$ plus $U_0$) in the following results. By comparing the results of short-range (few shells) and long-range (many shells) interactions, we investigate the role of the interaction range.

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $H$ through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ($t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$) in the first Hartree term ($\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s,s'}\sum_{i,j}U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of $i$ and $j$ is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes $s$ and $s'$.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)=U(\bm{R}_j-\bm{R}_i)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified $H$.

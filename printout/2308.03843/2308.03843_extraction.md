 Coulomb interaction between any two lattice sites,

is the screened form of the interaction in the presence of symmetric
gates located at the top and bottom of the TBG heterostructure
\cite{Throckmorton,Bernevig2}, with $e$ the electron charge and
$\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\alpha}$ the position of a site in sublattice
$\alpha$ measured from the center of its unit cell. $\xi\approx10$\,nm
is the distance between the plates of the metallic gates in most experiments
\cite{Stepanov,Saito}, and $\varepsilon$ is the background dielectric
constant, which we treat as a free adjustable parameter. The value
of the dielectric constant of graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) is $\varepsilon\approx6$, although polarization effects
due to remote bands in TBG could effectively make it several times
larger \cite{Potasz,Gonzalez}. We regularize the on-site Coulomb
interaction by choosing the onsite Hubbard term $V_{\alpha\alpha}(\bm{R}=0)=12.4/\varepsilon\,$eV
of single layer graphene \cite{Wehling} and then smoothly interpolating
it with Eq.~\eqref{eq:Hc} through $V_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{R})\approx1.438/[\varepsilon(0.116+|\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\alpha}-\boldsymbol{\bm{\tau}}_{\beta}+\bm{R}|)]$
eV \cite{Radamaker}. Although this choice is not unique, the results
do not depend on the details of the regularization.

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction.

 You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term, {Hartree\_second\_quantized\_symbol}, by reducing the momentum inside the expected value {expected\_value}.

The expected value {expected\_value} is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, {expected\_value\_nonzero}.

You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{k_i,k_j}}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

Return the final simplified Hartree term {Hartree\_second\_quantized\_symbol}.

$$
Here $\bar{h}_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k},\sigma)=h_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k})+h_{\alpha\beta}^{\text{H}}(\bm{k},\sigma)+h_{\alpha\beta}^{\text{F}}(\bm{k},\sigma)$
is the renormalized matrix elements due to both Hartree, 
$$
h_{\alpha\beta}^{\text{H}}(\bm{k},\sigma)=\delta_{\alpha\beta}\sum_{\gamma,\bm{k}^{\prime},\sigma^{\prime}}V_{\beta\gamma}(0)\rho_{\gamma\gamma}(\bm{k}^{\prime},\sigma^{\prime}),\label{eq:H_H}
$$
and Fock contributions, 
$$
h_{\alpha\beta}^{\text{F}}(\bm{k},\sigma)=-\sum_{\bm{k}^{\prime}}V_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k}-\bm{k}^{\prime})\rho_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k}^{\prime},\sigma).\label{eq:H_F}
$$
Each contribution can be cast in terms of the $N_{b}\times N_{b}$
zero-temperature density matrix for a given momentum and spin,
$$
\rho_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k},\sigma)=\sum_{n}^{\text{occupied}}\phi_{\alpha,\bm{k}}^{(n)}(\sigma)\phi_{\beta,\bm{k}}^{(n)*}(\sigma),\label{eq:rho}
$$
which is defined as a sum over all occupied bands, with $n=1,\ldots,N_{b}$.
The $N_{b}$-component spinors $\phi_{\alpha,\bm{k}}^{(n)}(\sigma)$
describe the exact eigenvectors of Eq.~\eqref{eq:H_HF}, which need to
be calculated self-consistently while enforcing a fixed total number of
particles per unit cell. 


**Completion**

You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term, $h_{\alpha\beta}^{\text{H}}(\bm{k},\sigma)$, by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\rho_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k},\sigma)$.

The expected value $\rho_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k},\sigma)$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $\bm{k},\bm{k}^{\prime}$ are the same, namely, $\rho_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{k},\sigma)=\delta_{\alpha\beta}\sum_{\gamma,\bm{k}^{\prime},\sigma^{\prime}}V_{\beta\gamma}(0)\rho_{\gamma\gamma}(\bm{k}^{\prime},\sigma^{\prime})$.

You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{\bm{k},\bm{k}^{\prime}}}$ to reduce one momentum $\bm{k}$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

Return the final simplified Hartree term $h_{\alpha\beta}^{\text{H}}(\bm{k},\sigma)$.

Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

# Identify kinetic term (lattice)
**Prompt**

I will provide you a Excerpt of physics paper, and a Template. You will need to fill the placeholders in the template using the correct information from the excerpt.
Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

Finally, if you cannot figure out the placeholder, you should leave it as is.

I will provide you a Excerpt of physics paper, and a Template. You will need to fill the placeholders in the template using the correct information from the excerpt.
Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

Finally, if you cannot figure out the placeholder, you should leave it as is.

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol}.
 

 Excerpt:

 $$\begin{aligned}\label{eq:hubbard}
	H&=&\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}\nonumber\\
	&+&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s,s'}\sum_{i,j}U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s},
\end{aligned}$$
where {the hopping terms $t_s$ represent band structures (depending on $\theta$), and effective interparticle Coulomb interactions $U$  represent the correlation effect (depending on $\epsilon$)}. Valley index $s$ , spin-up or down, is coupled with $+K$  or $-K$  valley, respectively, in the Brillouin zone~\cite{pan2020band}. {Both} $t$ and $U$ involve distant nearest neighbors ({i.e., our parametrization of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} includes hopping up to the third nearest neighbors and Coulomb coupling term $U$ up to 1993 distant sites}), refer to Refs.~\onlinecite{pan2020band,pan2020quantum,wu2018hubbard,wu2019topological} for the motivation and derivation of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} as the basic description for the interacting moir\'e physics in TTMD systems.  Although the theory based on Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} should apply to all TTMD systems, our specific numerical results are for the WSe${}_2$ based TTMD structures currently being studied at Columbia University~\cite{wang2020correlated}.  Details of the numerical model for Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} {are available in Refs.}~\onlinecite{pan2020band,pan2020quantum}.  We emphasize that Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} cannot be thought of as either a Hubbard (or extended Hubbard) model or a {WC} (or generalized WC) model. Equation~\eqref{eq:hubbard} is a semirealistic model for the actual interacting TTMD 2D moir\'e materials.


**Completion**

You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term H through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value (t_{s}) in the first Hartree term (c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term (c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified H.

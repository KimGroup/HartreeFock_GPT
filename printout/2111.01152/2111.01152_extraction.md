For each valley, the $2\times 2$ Hamiltonian hybridizes the bottom layer ($\mathfrak{b}$) and top layer ($\mathfrak{t}$), where the off diagonal terms describe the interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}$, and the diagonal terms describe the momentum-shifted kinetic energy with the effective mass $(m_{\mathfrak{b}},m_{\mathfrak{t}})=(0.65,0.35)m_e$ ($m_e$ is the rest electron mass), plus the intralayer potential $\Delta_{\mathfrak{b}/\mathfrak{t}}$, and a band offset $V_{z\mathfrak{t}}$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(b)]. Our $H_\tau$ differs from that in Ref.~\onlinecite{zhang2021spintextured} by a gauge transformation. 


**Completion**

You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in a system with two layers in the momentum space in the second-quantized form.

where $\tau=\pm 1$ represents $\pm K$ valleys, and $\bm{\kappa}=\frac{4\pi}{3a_M}\left(1,0\right)$  is at a corner of the  moir\'e Brillouin zone.  For each valley, the $2\times 2$ Hamiltonian hybridizes the bottom layer ($\mathfrak{b}$) and top layer ($\mathfrak{t}$), where the off diagonal terms describe the interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}$, and the diagonal terms describe the momentum-shifted kinetic energy with the effective mass $(m_{\mathfrak{b}},m_{\mathfrak{t}})=(0.65,0.35)m_e$ ($m_e$ is the rest electron mass), plus the intralayer potential $\Delta_{\mathfrak{b}/\mathfrak{t}}$, and a band offset $V_{z\mathfrak{t}}$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(b)]. Our $H_\tau$ differs from that in Ref.~\onlinecite{zhang2021spintextured} by a gauge transformation.

We set $\Delta_{\mathfrak{t}}(\bm{r})=0$, since the low-energy physics only involves the band maximum of WSe$_2$ \cite{zhang2021spintextured}.  The interlayer tunneling term is
$$\label{eq:Delta_T}
    \Delta_{\text{T},\tau}(\bm{r})=\tau w \left(1+\omega^{\tau} e^{i\tau\bm{g}_2\cdot\bm{r}}+\omega^{2\tau} e^{i\tau\bm{g}_3\cdot\bm{r}} \right),
$$
where $w$ describes the tunneling strength, and $\omega=e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}$ following the $C_{3z}$ symmetry \cite{zhang2021spintextured}. The valley dependence of $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}$ is constrained by $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Here $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}$ couples states with opposite spins, which is symmetry allowed because the heterobilayer breaks the $z \rightarrow -z$  mirror symmetry. For parameters in $H_\tau$, we take $\psi_{\mathfrak{b}}=-14^{\circ}$ such that the potential maximum of $\Delta_{\mathfrak{b}}(\bm{r})$ is at the MM site \cite{zhang2021spintextured}; $V_{z\mathfrak{t}}$ is a parameter that is experimentally controllable by an applied out-of-plane displacement field; $V_{\mathfrak{b}}$ and $w$ are taken as theoretical parameters that can be adjusted to study different phases. We note that the interlayer tunneling 
strength $w$ can be modified by pressure.

The noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_0$ is the sum of Kinetic Hamiltonian $-\frac{\hbar^2\bm{k}^2}{2m_{\mathfrak{b}}}$ and $-\frac{\hbar^2\left(\bm{k}-\tau \bm{\kappa}\right)^2}{2m_{\mathfrak{t}}}$ and Potential Hamiltonian $\Delta_{\mathfrak{b},\tau}(\bm{r})$, $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}(\bm{r})$, $\Delta_{\text{T},\tau}^\dag(\bm{r})$, $\Delta_{\mathfrak{t,\tau}}(\bm{r})$, and $V_{z\mathfrak{t}}$.

To construct the second quantized form of a Hamiltonian. You should construct the creation and annihilation operators from the basis explicitly. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to convert a Hamiltonian from the single-particle form to second-quantized form.

Finally by "total", it means you need to take a summation over the real space position $r$.

**Completion**

You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the Hartree-Fock term symbol, denoted as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$.

The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}$ and $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.

You should only preserve the quadratic terms in $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$, denoted as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$.

Return $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$.


Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):

$\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ is the Hartree-Fock term symbol, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{int}}^{\text{HF}}$ is the Hartree-Fock second quantized symbol, and $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}$ and $b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$ are the bilinear operators.



# Combine Hartree/Fock terms
**Prompt**

I will provide you a Excerpt of physics paper, and a Template. You will need to fill the placeholders in the template using the correct information from the excerpt.
Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

Finally, if you cannot figure out the placeholder, you should leave it as is.

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)

**Completion**

You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ($\expval{b_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}}$ and $\expval{b_{\bm{k}_{\alpha},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}}$) in the first Hartree term ($b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\gamma},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($b_{\bm{k}_{\beta},l_{\beta},\tau_{\beta}}^\dagger b_{\bm{k}_{\delta},l_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha}}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified $\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{\text{HF}}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term).

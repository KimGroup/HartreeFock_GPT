 Excerpt:

 $$\begin{aligned}\label{eq:hubbard}
	H&=&\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}\nonumber\\
	&+&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s,s'}\sum_{i,j}U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s},
\end{aligned}$$
where $\bm{R}_i$ represents the position of site $i$ in a triangular lattice formed in the moir\'e pattern [Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}(a)], $s$ is the spin index, and $t$ and $U$ are, respectively, the hopping parameter and the interaction strength. As proposed in Refs.~\cite{wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, pan2020band}, the model in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} can be simulated in twisted TMD heterobilayers as well as homobilayers. For definiteness, we use twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) as the model system in this work, and Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} is then constructed following our previous work \cite{pan2020band} for low-energy holes in the first moir\'e valence band at $\pm K$ valleys. Here we use  $c_{i,s}^\dagger$ to represent the hole operator, and $s=\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ are locked to $+K$ and $-K$ valleys, respectively. We define a filling factor $\nu$ as $(1/\mathcal{N}) \sum_{i,s} c_{i,s}^{\dagger} c_{i,s}$, which counts the number of holes per moir\'e cell ($\mathcal{N}$ is the total number of moir\'e sites in the system). The charge neutrality point of the semiconducting twisted bilayer corresponds to $\nu=0$. For simplicity, we assume that  no external out-of-plane displacement field is applied to WSe$_2$, and then the model in  Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} respects emergent spin SU(2) symmetry and $C_6$ point group symmetry. An important advantage of the moir\'e platform is that both the hopping parameters and the interaction strength are highly tunable. Generally speaking, the moir\'e bandwidth becomes narrower at smaller twist angle (larger moir\'e period) and many-body interaction effects become more prominent~\cite{wu2018hubbard, wu2019topological, naik2018ultraflatbands}. We show the twist-angle dependence of $t$ and $U$ in the Supplemental Material \cite{SM} (see, also, Refs.~\cite{fukui2005chern,yu2011equivalent} therein). In the calculation of $U$, we project a screened Coulomb interaction $(e^2/\epsilon)(1/r-1/\sqrt{r^2+d^2})$ to the low-energy moir\'e states, where $\epsilon$ is the background dielectric constant that is tunable by the dielectric environment and $d/2$ is the distance between the moir\'e system and a nearby metallic gate. We take $\epsilon$ as a free parameter and  $d$, which is also experimentally controllable, to be 60 nm in calculations.



**Completion**

You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) in the real space in the second-quantized form. 

The degrees of freedom of the system are: the position of site $i$ in a triangular lattice formed in the moir\'e pattern, and the spin index $s$.   

The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 
site i and site j with the amplitude $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$
You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.
The summation should be taken over all degrees of freedom and all real space positions.

Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:

$\bm{R}_i$ represents the position of site $i$ in a triangular lattice formed in the moir\'e pattern, $s$ is the spin index, and $t$ and $U$ are, respectively, the hopping parameter and the interaction strength. $c_{i,s}^\dagger$ is used to represent the hole operator, and $s=\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ are locked to $+K$ and $-K$ valleys, respectively. A filling factor $\nu$ is defined as $(1/\mathcal{N}) \sum_{i,s} c_{i,s}^{\dagger} c_{i,s}$, which counts the number of holes per moir\'e cell ($\mathcal{N}$ is the total number of moir\'e sites in the system).

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol}.

You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $H_{\text{int}}$ through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ($\expval{c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}}$ and $\expval{c_{\bm{k}_\alpha,s}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\gamma,s'}}$) in the first Hartree term ($c_{\bm{k}_\beta,s'}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\gamma,s'}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($c_{\bm{k}_\beta,s'}^\dagger c_{\bm{k}_\delta,s}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of $\bm{k}_\gamma \leftrightarrow \bm{k}_\delta$ is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes $\bm{k}_\alpha, \bm{k}_\beta$.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $U(\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta)=U(-(\bm{k}_\alpha-\bm{k}_\delta))$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified $H_{\text{int}}$.

**Prompt**

I will provide you a Excerpt of physics paper, and a Template. You will need to fill the placeholders in the template using the correct information from the excerpt.
Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

Finally, if you cannot figure out the placeholder, you should leave it as is.

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term in {Hartree\_second\_quantized\_symbol} by reducing the momentum inside the expected value {expected\_value}.

The expected value {expected\_value} is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, {expected\_value\_nonzero}.

You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{k_i,k_j}}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $b_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the $\HH_{\rm MF}$.

The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to $\hat{C}^{\dag}_{\kk s}\HH_{\kk s}\hat{C}^{\phantom{\dag}}_{\kk s}$, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.

You should only preserve the quadratic terms in $\HH_{\rm MF}$, denoted as $\HH_{\kk s}$.

Return $\HH_{\kk s}$.


Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):

$\HH_{\rm MF}$ is the mean-field Hamiltonian, $\hat{C}^{\dag}_{\kk s}$ is the creation operator, $\HH_{\kk s}$ is the Hamiltonian matrix, and $\hat{C}^{\phantom{\dag}}_{\kk s}$ is the annihilation operator. The elements of the matrix $\HH_{\kk s}$ are given by $\gamma_1(k_i)$, $\gamma_2(\kk)$, $\xi_{x}$, $\xi_{y}$, and $\xi_{d}$. The effective interaction parameters are $\tilde{U}_{p}$, $\tilde{V}_{pp}$, and $\tilde{U}_{d}$. The total density of holes is denoted by $n$, the total density of holes on the oxygen sites is denoted by $n^p$, and the nematic order parameter is denoted by $\eta$.

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

Namely, a replacement of {relabel} is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes {Unsummed\_Indices}.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

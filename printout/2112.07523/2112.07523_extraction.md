 Excerpt:

 The field operators are four-component spinors $\psi_{\bm k}=(a_{c\uparrow\bm k},a_{v\uparrow\bm k},a_{c\downarrow\bm k},a_{v\downarrow\bm k})^T$, where $c$ and $v$ denote the conduction and valence bands, and $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ denote two opposite spins.
The single-particle physics of the system under an in-plane magnetic field is described by the modified BHZ 
Hamiltonian \cite{Hu2016,hu2017topological}
$$ \label{eq:H_BHZ}
H_{\rm{BHZ}} = \sum_{\bm k} \psi_{\bm k}^{\dagger} \left(\begin{array}{cc}
h_{\uparrow}(\bm k) & 0 \\
0 & h_{\downarrow}(\bm k)
\end{array}\right) \psi_{\bm k},
$$
where the two $2\times 2$ matrices $h_{\uparrow}$ and $h_{\downarrow}$ can be explicitly expressed as
$$ \label{eq:h}
\begin{split}
h_{\uparrow}(\bm k) &= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}(\bm k-\frac{\bm Q}{2})^2+\frac{E_g}{2} & A(k_x+ik_y) \\
A(k_x-ik_y) & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_h}(\bm k+\frac{\bm Q}{2})^2-\frac{E_g}{2}
\end{array}\right), \\
h_{\downarrow}(\bm k) &= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}(\bm k-\frac{\bm Q}{2})^2+\frac{E_g}{2} & -A(k_x-ik_y) \\
-A(k_x+ik_y) & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_h}(\bm k+\frac{\bm Q}{2})^2-\frac{E_g}{2}
\end{array}\right).
\end{split}
$$
$m_e$ and $m_h$ are the effective masses of electrons and holes, $E_g$ is the band gap, $A$ is the strength of hybridization between the conduction and valence bands, and $\bm Q$ is the momentum shift due to the in-plane magnetic field. Without the magnetic field, $\bm Q=0$ and $h_{\uparrow},h_{\downarrow}$ are time-reversal partners:
$$
h_{\uparrow}(\bm k) = h_{\downarrow}^*(-\bm k).
$$
When an in-plane magnetic field $\bm B=B\hat y$ is applied to electron and hole layers separated by an interlayer distance $d$, the conduction and valence bands are shifted in momentum by $\mp \bm Q=\mp (eBd/\hbar) \hat x$ by Peierls substitution. 
The in-plane magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry of the system and 
induces orbital moments.  The electrons and holes interact via the Coulomb interaction


**Completion**

You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in a system under an in-plane magnetic field in the momentum space in the single-particle form.

Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{\rm{BHZ}}$ using $h_{\uparrow}$, $h_{\downarrow}$, $\psi_{\bm k}^{\dagger}$, and $\psi_{\bm k}$, where the summation of ${k}$ should be running over the entire space.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:

$h_{\uparrow}$ and $h_{\downarrow}$ are the two $2\times 2$ matrices that can be explicitly expressed as given in the excerpt. $m_e$ and $m_h$ are the effective masses of electrons and holes, $E_g$ is the band gap, $A$ is the strength of hybridization between the conduction and valence bands, and $\bm Q$ is the momentum shift due to the in-plane magnetic field.

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)

where the density matrix $\rho$ is defined relative to the density matrix with valence bands filled and conduction bands empty:
$$ \label{eq:rho}

$$
For $n'=n$, the Hartree term accounts for the electrostatic potential energy difference $4\pi e^2 n_x d/\epsilon$ between the electron and hole layers, where
$$

$$
\begin{split}
\Sigma_F = -\frac{1}{S}\sum_{bb'\atop ss'}\sum_{nn'n''\atop \bm k\bm k'} &V_{bb'}((n''-n)\bm Q+\bm k'-\bm k) \\
\times&\rho_{bs\,n''}^{b's'\,n''+n'-n}(\bm k') a_{b's'n'\bm k}^{\dagger} a_{bsn\bm k}.

$$
accounts for the exchange interaction. Together, the system is described by the mean-field Hamiltonian
$$ \label{eq:H_MF}
H_{\rm{MF}} = H_{\rm{BHZ}} + \Sigma_H + \Sigma_F.
$$


**Completion**

You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $H_{\rm{MF}}$ through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ($\rho_{b's'\,n''}^{b's'\,n''+n'-n}(\bm k')$) in the first Hartree term ($\Sigma_H$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($\Sigma_F$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified $H_{\rm{MF}}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term).

 You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term in {Hartree\_second\_quantized\_symbol} by reducing the momentum inside the expected value {expected\_value}.

The expected value {expected\_value} is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, {expected\_value\_nonzero}.

You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{{k_i,k_j}}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $b_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

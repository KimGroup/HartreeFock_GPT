The valence bands of TMD heterobilayers 
and $\Gamma$-valley homobilayers \cite{mattia2020gammaValley} are 
described by emergent models in which interacting spin-$1/2$ electrons 
experience an external potential with triangular lattice periodicity, 
and therefore map directly to models of electrons on triangular or honeycomb lattices.

This paper is devoted to a study of the properties of
triangular lattice moir\'e materials
and focuses on the case of one-hole per moir\'e period, where 
correlations are strongest.

We examine the crossover from the narrow-band regime at 
small twist angles, 
where the system maps to a one-band Hubbard model with dominant on-site interactions,
to the regime closer to the metal-insulator phase transition where important differences appear.

Our discussion is based mainly on a mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation
used to address the interplay between periodic modulation
and Coulomb interactions that controls the hybridization 
between orbitals centered on different sites, and 
therefore exchange interactions of spins on the system's triangular lattice.

Because it is a mean-field approach, the Hartree-Fock approximation
cannot account for dynamic fluctuations in spin-configuration,
but can accurately describe the energy of particular spin-configurations.

Importantly for the present application, the Hartree-Fock approximation has the advantage over 
spin-density-functional theory \cite{liangfuCTI} 
that it correctly accounts for the absence of 
self-interaction \cite{selfInt81} when electrons are localized near lattice sites.
We expect the Hartree-Fock approximation to overestimate the stability of insulating states 
relative to metallic states. (Indeed this expectation is confirmed by comparisoin with separate exact-diagonalization calculations for the same model \cite{nicolas2020ed}.) 
Our calculations can therefore provide a lower bound on the 
moir\'e modulation strength that drives the system from a metallic to an insulating state
at a given interaction strength.  Unlike exact-diagonalization calcualations, Hartree-Fock calculations can be accurately converged with respect to system size.

Our goal in this manuscript is to identify differences between 
moir\'e material physics and single-band Hubbard model physics, with particular emphasis on the 
prospects for tuning the system into exotic spin liquid states. Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseD} shows the phase 
diagram in a space defined by dimensionless modulation strength $\alpha^2(V_M,\phi,a_M)$ and interaction 
strength $r_s^*(\epsilon, a_M)$ parameters. The full phase space of the problem is
actually 3-dimensional since the phase ($\phi$ - see below) of moir\'e potential Fourier amplitude also plays a role.
($a_M$ is the moir\'e material lattice constant.)
The lowest energy hole band is spectrally isolated for $\alpha\lesssim0.1$, the range covered in Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseD},
unless $\phi$ is very close to a honeycomb value.  (See below.)
We find that the three sublattice antiferromagnetism expected~ \cite{JolicoeurPhysRevB1990} in the insulating state 
transform to stripe magnetism and finally to ferromagnetism with increasing $r_s^*$, and that a semimetallic state 
with three sublattice order occurs on the metallic side of the metal-insulator phase transition.

The transition to ferromagnetic insulating states at strong interactions 
opens up new opportunities to engineer strongly frustrated quantum magnetism.
Given the possiblity of {\em in situ} tuning between different spin states,
these findings demonstrate that moir\'e materials are an exceptionally promising new system for the 
exploration of two-dimensional quantum magnetism.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:hf} we review the moir\'e material model, discuss expected properties,
and introduce the mean-field formalism. In Sec.~\ref{sec:results}, 
we discuss our results for spin-interactions in insulating moir\'e materials. 
We comment specifically on necessary conditions for non-zero Hall conductance, 
concluding that though non-trivial band topology is unlikely, applying a magnetic 
field might induce a non-zero Hall conductance in doped insulators.  Finally in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:outlook} we summarize our results and highlight important directions for 
future research.


\section{\label{sec:hf}Interacting continuum model}
The low energy physics of TMD moir\'e materials, like that of twisted bilayer graphene, is most conveniently captured by a continuum model \cite{fengchengHubbard}. Since TMDs are generally good insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling
from the transition metal atoms, only the topmost valence band needs to be included in the low energy model - yielding one 
state for each valley.  Because of spin-valley locking, we can equivalently choose to 
identify these states by their spins or by their valleys.

The type-II band alignment of TMD heterojunctions means that 
only one layer is active at low energy.

Hence the fermion field operators $\psi^{(\dag)}_{\alpha}(\b r)$ in this model carry only one label, 
representing locked spin/valley, while the effect of the other layer is integrated 
out, appearing only only as a contribution to the moir\'e potential \cite{fengchengDelta,fengchengHubbard},
$\Delta(\bm{r})$.
When the Fourier expansion of $\Delta$ is truncated at the first shell of 
moir\'e reciprocal lattice vectors $\mathbf{b}_j$,
$$
\Delta(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{j=1}^6 V_j \exp\[i\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{r}\],
$$
where $V_j = V_M\exp\[(-1)^{j-1}i\phi\]$.  $V_j$ and $\phi$ are material-dependent parameters, with 
$V_M$ characterizing the moir\'e modulation strength and $\phi$ its shape.
The single-particle Hamiltonian of the moir\'e continuum model 
$$\begin{aligned}
    H_{0} = T + \Delta(\mathbf{r}),\label{eq:model}
\end{aligned}$$
where $T$ is the single-particle kinetic energy operator for electrons with effective mass $m^*$,
is spin-independent.  In a plane-wave representation
$$\begin{aligned}
    {H_{0}}_{\b{b},\b{b}'}(\b{k}) 
    = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*}\(\b{k}+\b{b}\)^2 \, \delta_{\b{b},\b{b}'} + \sum_{j=1}^6 V_j\delta_{\b{b}_j,\b{b}-\b{b}'},
\end{aligned}$$
where momentum $\b{k}$ is in the first moir\'e Brillouin zone and the $\b{b}$'s are moir\'e reciprocal lattice vectors.


**Completion**

You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in TMD moiré materials in the real space in the single-particle form. 

The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin/valley.

Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $T$ using $\hbar$, $m^*$, $\b{k}$, and $\b{b}$, where the summation of $\b{k}$ should be running over the first Brillouin zone.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:

- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant
- $m^*$ is the effective mass of the electrons
- $\b{k}$ is the momentum in the first moiré Brillouin zone
- $\b{b}$'s are moiré reciprocal lattice vectors.

[In addition, a shift of {momentum\_shift} in the momentum ${k\_symbol}$ for {shifted\_Ek}, respectively.]

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to obtain the correct energy dispersion, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the type of dispersion.

Finally, in the real space, the momentum ${k\_symbol}=-i \partial_{{{r\_symbol}}}$. You should keep the form of ${k\_symbol}$ in the Hamiltonian for short notations but should remember ${k\_symbol}$ is an operator.

Return the expression for {Energy\_dispersion} in the Kinetic Hamiltonian, and substitute it into the Kinetic Hamiltonian {kinetic\_symbol}.

Stimulated by the recent experimental realization \cite{kim2017tunable,cao2018correlated,cao2018unconventional} of magic angle physics in twisted bilayer graphene, expeimental attention has expanded to 
include other graphene based multilayers with twists   \cite{Yankowitz1059,lu2019superconductors,sharpe2019emergent,Serlin2020IntrinsicQA,cao2020tunable,shen2020correlated,chen2019evidence,chen2019signatures}, and also

twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers \cite{tang2020tTMD,regan2020mott,wang2020correlated,xu2020correlated,jin2021stripe,li2021charge,li2021imaging,fractionTMD2020,mak2021continuousMIT,dean2021quantumcritical,li2021quantum}.

The valence bands of TMD heterobilayers 
and $\Gamma$-valley homobilayers \cite{mattia2020gammaValley} are 
described by emergent models in which interacting spin-$1/2$ electrons 
experience an external potential with triangular lattice periodicity, 
and therefore map directly to models of electrons on triangular or honeycomb lattices.

This paper is devoted to a study of the properties of
triangular lattice moir\'e materials
and focuses on the case of one-hole per moir\'e period, where 
correlations are strongest.

We examine the crossover from the narrow-band regime at 
small twist angles, 
where the system maps to a one-band Hubbard model with dominant on-site interactions,
to the regime closer to the metal-insulator phase transition where important differences appear.

Our discussion is based mainly on a mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation
used to address the interplay between periodic modulation
and Coulomb interactions that controls the hybridization 
between orbitals centered on different sites, and 
therefore exchange interactions of spins on the system's triangular lattice.

Because it is a mean-field approach, the Hartree-Fock approximation
cannot account for dynamic fluctuations in spin-configuration,
but can accurately describe the energy of particular spin-configurations.

Importantly for the present application, the Hartree-Fock approximation has the advantage over 
spin-density-functional theory \cite{liangfuCTI} 
that it correctly accounts for the absence of 
self-interaction \cite{selfInt81} when electrons are localized near lattice sites.
We expect the Hartree-Fock approximation to overestimate the stability of insulating states 
relative to metallic states. (Indeed this expectation is confirmed by comparisoin with separate exact-diagonalization calculations for the same model \cite{nicolas2020ed}.) 
Our calculations can therefore provide a lower bound on the 
moir\'e modulation strength that drives the system from a metallic to an insulating state
at a given interaction strength.  Unlike exact-diagonalization calcualations, Hartree-Fock calculations can be accurately converged with respect to system size.

Our goal in this manuscript is to identify differences between 
moir\'e material physics and single-band Hubbard model physics, with particular emphasis on the 
prospects for tuning the system into exotic spin liquid states. Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseD} shows the phase 
diagram in a space defined by dimensionless modulation strength $\alpha^2(V_M,\phi,a_M)$ and interaction 
strength $r_s^*(\epsilon, a_M)$ parameters. The full phase space of the problem is
actually 3-dimensional since the phase ($\phi$ - see below) of moir\'e potential Fourier amplitude also plays a role.
($a_M$ is the moir\'e material lattice constant.)
The lowest energy hole band is spectrally isolated for $\alpha\lesssim0.1$, the range covered in Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseD},
unless $\phi$ is very close to a honeycomb value.  (See below.)
We find that the three sublattice antiferromagnetism expected~ \cite{JolicoeurPhysRevB1990} in the insulating state 
transform to stripe magnetism and finally to ferromagnetism with increasing $r_s^*$, and that a semimetallic state 
with three sublattice order occurs on the metallic side of the metal-insulator phase transition.

The transition to ferromagnetic insulating states at strong interactions 
opens up new opportunities to engineer strongly frustrated quantum magnetism.
Given the possiblity of {\em in situ} tuning between different spin states,
these findings demonstrate that moir\'e materials are an exceptionally promising new system for the 
exploration of two-dimensional quantum magnetism.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:hf} we review the moir\'e material model, discuss expected properties,
and introduce the mean-field formalism. In Sec.~\ref{sec:results}, 
we discuss our results for spin-interactions in insulating moir\'e materials. 
We comment specifically on necessary conditions for non-zero Hall conductance, 
concluding that though non-trivial band topology is unlikely, applying a magnetic 
field might induce a non-zero Hall conductance in doped insulators.  Finally in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:outlook} we summarize our results and highlight important directions for 
future research.


\section{\label{sec:hf}Interacting continuum model}
The low energy physics of TMD moir\'e materials, like that of twisted bilayer graphene, is most conveniently captured by a continuum model \cite{fengchengHubbard}. Since TMDs are generally good insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling
from the transition metal atoms, only the topmost valence band needs to be included in the low energy model - yielding one 
state for each valley.  Because of spin-valley locking, we can equivalently choose to 
identify these states by their spins or by their valleys.

The type-II band alignment of TMD heterojunctions means that 
only one layer is active at low energy.

Hence the fermion field operators $\psi^{(\dag)}_{\alpha}(\b r)$ in this model carry only one label, 
representing locked spin/valley, while the effect of the other layer is integrated 
out, appearing only only as a contribution to the moir\'e potential \cite{fengchengDelta,fengchengHubbard},
$\Delta(\bm{r})$.
When the Fourier expansion of $\Delta$ is truncated at the first shell of 
moir\'e reciprocal lattice vectors $\mathbf{b}_j$,
$$
\Delta(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{j=1}^6 V_j \exp\[i\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{r}\],
$$
where $V_j = V_M\exp\[(-1)^{j-1}i\phi\]$.  $V_j$ and $\phi$ are material-dependent parameters, with 
$V_M$ characterizing the moir\'e modulation strength and $\phi$ its shape.
The single-particle Hamiltonian of the moir\'e continuum model 
$$\begin{aligned}
    H_{0} = T + \Delta(\mathbf{r}),\label{eq:model}
\end{aligned}$$
where $T$ is the single-particle kinetic energy operator for electrons with effective mass $m^*$,
is spin-independent.  In a plane-wave representation
$$\begin{aligned}
    {H_{0}}_{\b{b},\b{b}'}(\b{k}) 
    = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*}\(\b{k}+\b{b}\)^2 \, \delta_{\b{b},\b{b}'} + \sum_{j=1}^6 V_j\delta_{\b{b}_j,\b{b}-\b{b}'},
\end{aligned}$$
where momentum $\b{k}$ is in the first moir\'e Brillouin zone and the $\b{b}$'s are moir\'e reciprocal lattice vectors.

 Excerpt:

 is that the lowest energy hole band is isolated and has a bandwidth $W$ that 
decreases exponentially with moir\'e period $a_M$. 
One physical intuition for this behavior is based on the observation that the 
model can be 
approximated, in the large-$a_M$ limit, as a lattice of weakly coupled harmonically confined electrons. 
Ignoring the ``remote-band'' holes for the moment, we can readily see that the largest effect of 
Coulomb interactions is to impose an energy penalty $U$ on doubly occupied sites,
which is the essence of Hubbard model physics. But in contrast to simplest nearest-neighbor Hubbard model,
the ratio of second nearest-neighbor hopping to the nearest-neighbor hopping can be increased by decreasing the modulation strength, a property easily explained in the harmonic oscillator approximation, increasing the magnetic
frustration of insulating states.

over occupied moir\'e-band Bloch wavefunctions.  The mean-field electronic structure of moir\'e superlattices is best 
evaluated using a plane-wave representation in which the Hartree-Fock self energy $\Sigma^{HF}$ at each 
$\b{k}$ in the Brillouin-zone is a matrix in reciprocal lattice vectors $\b{b}$:
\begin{widetext}
$$
    \Sigma^{HF}_{\alpha,\b{b};\beta,\b{b}'}(\b{k}) = \frac{\delta_{\alpha,\beta}}{A}\sum_{\alpha'}V_{\alpha'\alpha}(\b{b}'-\b{b})\sum_{\b{k}',\b{b}''}\rho_{\alpha',\b{b}+\b{b}'';\alpha',\b{b}'+\b{b}''}(\b{k}')  -\frac{1}{A}\sum_{\b{b}'',k'}V_{\alpha\beta}(\b{b}''+\b{k}'-\b{k})\rho_{\alpha,\b{b}+\b{b}'';\beta,\b{b}'+\b{b}''}(\b{k}').
\label{eq:self-energy}
$$

discrete Brillouin-zone mesh, and $\rho_{\alpha,\b{b};\beta,\b{b}'}$ is the self-consistently determined 
momentum-space density matrix.   Starting with a physically plausible density matrix $\rho_0$, we minimize the energy by performing self-consistent iterations. Because the many-body interaction is invariant under both translations and 
spin-rotations, if we start from a density matrix $\rho_0$ which satisfies a symmetry $\hat{O}$ of $H_0$ 
($[\rho_0,\hat{O}] = 0$, $[H_0,\hat{O}] = 0$) then the symmetry survives under iteration.

That is to say that $H^{HF}$ commutes with $\hat{O}$ at every iteration step.  In many-cases the minimum 
energy Hartree-Fock state breaks symmetries of $H_0$ and these solutions are found under iteration only 
by starting with a broken-symmetry density-matrix. 
As argued in Sec.~\ref{sec:lim}, the phase diagram contains paramagnetic states that do not break 
any symmetries, ferromagnetic states with spontaneous 
collinear spin-polarization that do not break lattice translational symmetries,
stripe states with collinear order and a doubled unit cell area, 
and 120$\degree$ N\'eel states with both a tripled unit cell area and and non-collinear spin-order.
We obtain solutions of the first two kinds by appropriate choices of the initial density $\rho_0$.
Each possible type of reduced translational symmetry implies a different reciprocal lattice,
and therefore has to be encoded explicitly in the recriprocal lattice employed and considered separately.
Solutions can be classified as insulating with a gap between occupied and empty states, or 
metallic with Fermi surfaces in the Brillouin-zone on which occupation numbers change.

At one electron per moir\'e period, the paramagnetic state must be metallic, but all other 
states we consider can be insulating. We show typical Hartree-Fock self-consistent band structures for insulating and metallic magnetic ordered sates in Fig.~\ref{fig:hfbands}.

 single Slater determinant ground state.  Minimizing the energy functional with respect to 
single-particle wave-functions yields a mean-field Hamiltonian that adds an interaction self-energy 
$\Sigma^{HF}$ to the single-particle Hamiltonian which can be expressed 
in terms of the single-particle density matrix $\rho = \sum_{n} \ket{\psi_n}\bra{\psi_n}$, where the sum is 
over occupied moir\'e-band Bloch wavefunctions.  The mean-field electronic structure of moir\'e superlattices is best 
evaluated using a plane-wave representation in which the Hartree-Fock self energy $\Sigma^{HF}$ at each 
$\b{k}$ in the Brillouin-zone is a matrix in reciprocal lattice vectors $\b{b}$:
\begin{widetext}
$$
    \Sigma^{HF}_{\alpha,\b{b};\beta,\b{b}'}(\b{k}) = \frac{\delta_{\alpha,\beta}}{A}\sum_{\alpha'}V_{\alpha'\alpha}(\b{b}'-\b{b})\sum_{\b{k}',\b{b}''}\rho_{\alpha',\b{b}+\b{b}'';\alpha',\b{b}'+\b{b}''}(\b{k}')  -\frac{1}{A}\sum_{\b{b}'',k'}V_{\alpha\beta}(\b{b}''+\b{k}'-\b{k})\rho_{\alpha,\b{b}+\b{b}'';\beta,\b{b}'+\b{b}''}(\b{k}').
\label{eq:self-energy}
$$
\end{widetext}
In Eq.~\ref{eq:self-energy} Greek letters label spin, $A$ is the finite sample area corresponding to a 
discrete Brillouin-zone mesh, and $\rho_{\alpha,\b{b};\beta,\b{b}'}$ is the self-consistently determined 
momentum-space density matrix.   Starting with a physically plausible density matrix $\rho_0$, we minimize the energy by performing self-consistent iterations. Because the many-body interaction is invariant under both translations and 
spin-rotations, if we start from a density matrix $\rho_0$ which satisfies a symmetry $\hat{O}$ of $H_0$ 
($[\rho_0,\hat{O}] = 0$, $[H_0,\hat{O}] = 0$) then the symmetry survives under iteration.

That is to say that $H^{HF}$ commutes with $\hat{O}$ at every iteration step.  In many-cases the minimum 
energy Hartree-Fock state breaks symmetries of $H_0$ and these solutions are found under iteration only 
by starting with a broken-symmetry density-matrix. 
As argued in Sec.~\ref{sec:lim}, the phase diagram contains paramagnetic states that do not break 
any symmetries, ferromagnetic states with spontaneous 
collinear spin-polarization that do not break lattice translational symmetries,
stripe states with collinear order and a doubled unit cell area, 
and 120$\degree$ N\'eel states with both a tripled unit cell area and and non-collinear spin-order.
We obtain solutions of the first two kinds by appropriate choices of the initial density $\rho_0$.
Each possible type of reduced translational symmetry implies a different reciprocal lattice,
and therefore has to be encoded explicitly in the recriprocal lattice employed and considered separately.
Solutions can be classified as insulating with a gap between occupied and empty states, or 
metallic with Fermi surfaces in the Brillouin-zone on which occupation numbers change.

At one electron per moir\'e period, the paramagnetic state must be metallic, but all other 
states we consider can be insulating. We show typical Hartree-Fock self-consistent band structures for insulating and metallic magnetic ordered sates in Fig.~\ref{fig:hfbands}.

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)

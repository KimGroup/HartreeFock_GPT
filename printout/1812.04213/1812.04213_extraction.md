 Excerpt:

 Below we first explain the formalism for the flavorless case, {\it i.e.} the valley projected and spinless case,
and then extend it to include both spin and valley degrees of freedom.
We choose the convention that the top and the bottom layers are respectively rotated counter-clockwise and 
clockwise around the $\hat{z}$ axis by a small angle $\theta/2$.
The relative displacement between layers prior to rotation does not affect the spectrum and is ignored in our tunneling 
Hamiltonian.  The quasiparticle wave functions in this theory are four component spinors, 
$\psi_{\alpha, \bm{k}}(\bm{r})$, $\alpha=\{A1, \ B1,\ A2,\ B2\}$, where $A(B)$ in the first index specifies sublattice 
and $1(2)$ in the second index specifies layer.

We solve the mean-field equations by expanding each component in a plane-wave 
basis consistent with the continuum model's spatial periodicity, which matches that of the moir\'e pattern.


The spinless single particle Hamiltonian projected onto valley K takes the form:
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{\hat{H}}^{\rm{K}}_{0} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
h_{\theta/2}(\bm{k}) & h_{T}(\bm{r})\\
h^\dagger_{T}(\bm{r})  & h_{-\theta/2}(\bm{k}')
\end{pmatrix} \label{ham}
\end{aligned}$$
where $\hat{h}_{\pm \theta/2}$ are the Dirac Hamiltonians for isolated rotated graphene layers,
$$\begin{aligned}
h_{\theta}(\bm{k}) = -\hbar v_D |\bar{\bm{k}}| 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & e^{i (\theta_{\bar{\bm{k}}}- \theta)} \\
e^{-i  (\theta_{\bar{\bm{k}}}- \theta)}  & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\end{aligned}$$
$\theta_{\bar{\bm{k}}}$ is the orientation angle of momentum measured from the Dirac point 
$\bar{\bm{k}}=\bm{k}-\bm{K}_{\theta}$.  ($\bm{K}_{\pm\theta/2}$ is the Dirac momentum of top(bottom) layer.)
Due to the moir\'{e} periodic modulation, interlayer tunneling is accompanied by momentum boosts 
$\bm{q}_j=\bm{0}$, $\bm{b}_1$ or $\bm{b}_2$ for $j=0, 1, 2$ respectively.
$\bm{b}_{1,2}=(\pm 1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_M)$
are the basis vectors of moir\'{e} reciprocal lattice, where $a_M=a/(2\sin(\theta/2))$ is the lattice constant of moire pattern 
and $a$ the lattice constant of monolayer graphene.
The spatial modulation of the tunneling Hamiltonian takes the form:
$$\begin{aligned}
h_T(\bm{r}) = \sum_{j=0}^3 T_j e^{-i\bm{q}_j\cdot \bm{r}}
\end{aligned}$$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
T_j = \omega_0\sigma_0 + \omega_1\cos(j\phi)\sigma_x + \omega_1\sin(j\phi)\sigma_y
\end{aligned}$$


**Completion**

You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the flavorless case, i.e. the valley projected and spinless case in the real space in the single-particle form. 

The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin and valley.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:

$\alpha=\{A1, \ B1,\ A2,\ B2\}$ where $A(B)$ in the first index specifies sublattice and $1(2)$ in the second index specifies layer. $\hat{h}_{\pm \theta/2}$ are the Dirac Hamiltonians for isolated rotated graphene layers. $\theta_{\bar{\bm{k}}}$ is the orientation angle of momentum measured from the Dirac point $\bar{\bm{k}}=\bm{k}-\bm{K}_{\theta}$. $\bm{K}_{\pm\theta/2}$ is the Dirac momentum of top(bottom) layer. $\bm{b}_{1,2}=(\pm 1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_M)$ are the basis vectors of moir\'{e} reciprocal lattice, where $a_M=a/(2\sin(\theta/2))$ is the lattice constant of moire pattern and $a$ the lattice constant of monolayer graphene. $h_T(\bm{r}) = \sum_{j=0}^3 T_j e^{-i\bm{q}_j\cdot \bm{r}}$ where $T_j = \omega_0\sigma_0 + \omega_1\cos(j\phi)\sigma_x + \omega_1\sin(j\phi)\sigma_y$.

You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term, $\Sigma^{\rm{H}} + \Sigma^{\rm{F}}$.

You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $\Sigma^{\rm{H}} + \Sigma^{\rm{F}}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four-term product with and without ${{}}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.

You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.

Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation as $\mathcal{H}$.

Template:

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)

Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{\bm{G}\bm{G}'}$ to reduce one momentum $\bm{G}$ but not $\bm{b}_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.

Return the final simplified Hartree term $\Sigma^{H}_{\alpha, \bm{G}; \beta, \bm{G}'}(\bm{k})$.

I will provide you a Excerpt of physics paper, and a Template. You will need to fill the placeholders in the template using the correct information from the excerpt.
Here are conventions:

{..} means a placeholder which you need to fill by extracting information from the excerpt.

{A|B} means you need to make a choice between A and B

[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

{{..}} DOES NOT mean a placeholder. You should not change the content inside double curly braces {{..}}.

'You should recall that {..}.' : this sentence should be kept as is.

Finally, if you cannot figure out the placeholder, you should leave it as is.

 Excerpt:

 Our principle results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{Summary}.
which sets the origin of real space at the center of the AA region. 
The magnitude of interlayer tunneling is taken to be $\omega_1\equiv T_{AB}=110meV$
and $\omega_0\equiv T_{AA}=0.8\omega_1$.
Below $\bm{k}$ is understood to be restricted
to the first moir\'{e} Brillouin zone (mBZ) ($\bm{k} \in$ mBZ).
For each  $\bm{k}$ we employ the plane-wave expansion basis $|\psi_{\alpha, \bm{G},\bm{k}}\rangle$
where $\bm{G}=m\bm{b}_1+n\bm{b}_2$ and $m,n$ are integers.
The single-particle Hamiltonian $\mathcal{\hat{H}}^{\rm{K}}_{0}$ has both terms
that are diagonal in reciprocal lattice vector and terms that are 
off-diagonal in reciprocal lattice vector.


We take electron-electron interactions into account using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock method.
In a plane wave basis,  the Hartree and Fock self-energies are
$$\begin{aligned}
\Sigma^{H}_{\alpha, \bm{G}; \beta, \bm{G}'}(\bm{k}) 
= \frac{1}{A} \sum_{\alpha'}
V_{\alpha'\alpha}(\bm{G}'-\bm{G}) 
\delta \rho_{\alpha'\alpha'}(\bm{G}-\bm{G}')  \delta_{\alpha\beta}
\label{hartreese}
\end{aligned}$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
\Sigma^{F}_{\alpha, \bm{G}; \beta, \bm{G}'}(\bm{k}) 
=-\frac{1}{A}\sum_{\bm{G}'', \bm{k}'}&
V_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{G}''+\bm{k}'-\bm{k}) \notag\\
&\times\delta \rho_{\alpha, \bm{G}+\bm{G}'';\beta, \bm{G}'+\bm{G}''} (\bm{k}')
%\rho_{\beta, \bm{G}'+\bm{G}'';\alpha, \bm{G}+\bm{G}''} (\bm{k}')
\label{fockse}
\end{aligned}$$
where $\delta\rho = \rho -\rho_{\rm{iso}}$ is the density matrix defined relative to that
of isolated rotated graphene layers each filled up to the charge neutrality point.
The density-matrix $\rho$ is defined in a plane wave basis as:
$$\begin{aligned}
%\rho_{\alpha,\bm{G};\beta,\bm{G}'}(\bm{k}) = \sum_{n} \; z^{n*}_{\alpha,\bm{G},\bm{k}}z^n_{\beta,\bm{G}',\bm{k}} --> change to standard convention
\rho_{\alpha,\bm{G};\beta,\bm{G}'}(\bm{k}) = \sum_{n} \; z^{n*}_{\beta,\bm{G}',\bm{k}}z^n_{\alpha,\bm{G},\bm{k}}
\end{aligned}$$
where the summation is over filled bands. We have also used
$\delta \rho_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{G})\equiv\sum_{\bm{k},\bm{G}_1}\delta \rho_{\alpha,\bm{G}_1+\bm{G}; \beta, \bm{G}_1}(\bm{k})$
in Eq.~\ref{hartreese}.
$z_{\alpha, \bm{G},\bm{k}}^n$ is a numerical 
eigenvector in the  plane-wave expansion,
$$\begin{aligned}
|\psi_{n,\bm{k}} \rangle = \sum_{\alpha, \bm{G}} z_{\alpha, \bm{G},\bm{k}}^n |\psi_{\alpha, \bm{G}+\bm{k}}\rangle,
\end{aligned}$$
obtained by diagonalizing the total Hamiltonian
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}^{\rm{K}}_0 +  \Sigma^{\rm{H}} + \Sigma^{\rm{F}}.
\end{aligned}$$

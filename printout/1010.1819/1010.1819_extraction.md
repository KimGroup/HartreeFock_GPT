Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian using variables which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of the four sublattice indexes. Note that the sublattice degrees of freedom is suppressed for now and will be stated later.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:

N is the total number of unit cells in the system, φ is the band's Wannier wavefunction, and κ labels the carbon site with position τκ relative to a the triangular lattice vector R_i. The notations A, B, Ā, B̄ are used for the four sublattice indexes κ, where B and Ā are the opposite-layer near-neighbor-pair sites.

 Excerpt:

 a Hartree-Fock mean-field theory approximation \cite{ostlund} is a natural first step in considering electron-electron interaction effects.
$V^{\kappa \kappa^{\prime}} \left( {\bm q} \right) =  2 \pi e^2 / \left(  \left| \bm q \right|   \epsilon_r \right)  $
when $\kappa$ and $\kappa^{\prime}$ refer to the same layer and 
$\left( 2 \pi e^2 /\left( { \left| \bm q \right|}   \epsilon_r \right)  \right)  \exp{ \left[  - \left| {\bm q} \right|  c \right] } $
when $\kappa$ and $\kappa^{\prime}$ refer to the opposite layers.
Here $\epsilon_r$ is the relative dielectric constant, 
$c=3.35 \AA$ is the interlayer separation,
$A$ is the total area of the graphene sheet, and we use

$$
\widetilde{f}\left( q \right) = (1 -  \left(r_0 q\right)^2 ) / (  (1 + \left(r_0 q \right)^2 )^4  )
\label{formfactor}
$$
as a form factor which accounts for the spread of the $\pi$-orbital charge on each site.
This simple form assumes an isotropic site-localized charge distribution.
Eq.~(\ref{formfactor}) was obtained by Fourier transforming the radial charge distribution of a hydrogenic $2 p$ orbital. 
The use of $r_0 = \widetilde{a}_0 = a_0/ \sqrt{30}$ would yield a root mean square radius
corresponding to the covalent radius of the carbon atom $a_0 = 0.77 \AA$. 
If we consider screening from the $\sigma$ band electrons neglected in our model and 
the fact that the charge density distribution of a $p_z$ orbital is far from spherical
we expect that larger values of $r_0$, which effectively 
reduce onsite repulsion, would be more appropriate.
For most of our calculations we have therefore used the value $r_0 = 3 \widetilde{a}_0$.

**Completion**

You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term, $V^{HF}$.

You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $V^{HF}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, select the correct EXAMPLE by noticing the order of four-term product with and without ${{}}^\dagger$, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.

You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.

Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation as $V^{HF}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):

$\lambda$ is a composite label for sublattice $\kappa$ and spin $\sigma$. $N_{\lambda}$ is the Hartree term and $W^{X}_{{\bm k} \lambda \lambda'}$ is the Fock (exchange) term. ${\bm G}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector.

 You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term {Hartree\_Fock\_second\_quantized\_symbol} through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ({expected\_value}) in the first Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_1}) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ({expression\_Hartree\_2}), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $V^{HF}$ through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.

The logic is that the expected value ($N_{\lambda}$ in the first Hartree term and $\left<c_{{\bm k}' \lambda'}^{\dag} c_{{\bm k}' \lambda} \right>$ in the second Fock term) in the first Hartree term ($U_H^{\lambda \lambda'} N_{\lambda'} c_{{\bm k} \lambda}^{\dag} c_{{\bm k} \lambda}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($W^{X}_{{\bm k} {\lambda' \lambda}}  c_{{\bm k} \lambda}^{\dag} c_{{\bm k} \lambda'}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term.

This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction.

**Completion**

You will now be instructed to combine the Hartree term $U_H^{\lambda \lambda'}$ and the Fock term $W^{X}_{{\bm k} {\lambda' \lambda}}$.

You should perform the same trick of relabeling the index in the Fock term to make the quadratic operators in the Fock term the same as those in the Hartree term. The relabeling should be done with a swap : {swap\_rule}.
You should add them, relabel the index in Fock term, and simply their sum. 
Return the final sum of Hartree and Fock term.

 Excerpt:

$$\label{eq:tb}
H_{\text{TB}}=\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s},
$$
where $s= \uparrow,\downarrow\$ represents spin $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ states associated respectively with $+K$ and $-K$ valleys, $\bm{R}_i$ represents a site in the triangular lattice, and $c_{j,s}$ ($c_{j,s}^\dagger$) is  electron annihilation (creation) operator. $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$ is the hopping parameter, which is constrained by the following relations. (1) Hermiticity of Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:tb} requires that $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}\right)= t_{s}^*\left(-\bm{R}\right)$; (2) threefold rotational symmetry ($C_3$) requires that $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}\right) =  t_{s}\left(\hat{\mathcal{R}}(2\pi/3)\bm{R}\right)$, where $\hat{\mathcal{R}}(2\pi/3)$ is a $2\pi/3$ rotation matrix; (3) time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) requires that $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}\right)= t_{-s}^*\left(\bm{R}\right)$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:lattice}, we use $\abs{t_n}$ and $\phi_{n}^{\uparrow}$ to denote the magnitude and phase for {\it representative} hopping parameters between $n$-th nearest neighbors in the spin $\uparrow$ channel. Since all the hopping terms within the $n$-th hopping shell are related by the aforementioned three relations, they can be determined once $\abs{t_n}$ and $\phi_{n}^{\uparrow}$ are determined.
$$\begin{aligned}\label{eq:hubbard}
H&=&\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}\nonumber\\
&+&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s,s'}\sum_{i,j}U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s},
\end{aligned}$$
where the repulsion $U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j)$ between sites $i$ and $j$ is calculated by projecting the Coulomb repulsion $\tilde{U}(\bm{r})=e^2/(\epsilon r)$ onto the Wannier states. Here $\epsilon$ is the effective background dielectric constant that can be controlled by the three-dimensional dielectric environment. We take $\epsilon$ as a free parameter in our theory since its precise value is tunable (and not always precisely known). Numerical values of $U_0$ (on site repulsion) and $U_n$ ($n=1,2,3$ for repulsion between $n$-th nearest neighbors) are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:hopping}(b). For a typical value of $\epsilon$ about 10, the on-site interaction $U_0$ can be at least one order-of-magnitude greater than the hopping parameters for twist angle $\theta$ below $5^{\circ}$. Therefore, tWSe$_2$ provides a platform to simulate the generalized Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. Moreover, the hopping parameters can be {\it in situ} controlled by an external displacement field. The effective interacting model is a generalized Hubbard model since both interaction and hopping in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} are not necessarily restricted to being on-site or nearest-neighbor, respectively as the whole many-body Hamiltonian matrix of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} can be calculated from our moir\'e band calculations for a given $\epsilon$.

You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian
The summation should be taken over all spin states and all real space positions.
